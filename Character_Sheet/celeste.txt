Humble player begs God to reconsider lack of skill if it hasn't been proved
in game yet....   Consider coolness factor of following tale...  (this is a
small segment of Celeste's memoirs, which I'm enthusiatically writing.
Perhaps God would be good enough to let this stand?  (This is one of the
only segments about Brand, by the way.  There are going to be few other
mentions of him.)
 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
I always liked Brand.  I'm loathe to admit that I probably started
cultivating a friendship simply because Father was unkindly towards him,
but it's likely true.  That was a simple way to irk father; how could I
pass it up?  It's probably the same reason I always was so sweet to Eric=85
Anyway, after a time I cam to genuinely like Brand.  I don't know, maybe it
was because he seemed more tortured and tragic than I, or maybe because he
was equally alone in Amber.  But I did enjoy his company.  He was a distant
person, and often as not was torn by some inner turmoil he wouldn't share.
Eventually his pain melted the ice in my heart and we grew into one of my
better friendships in Amber, part-time though it was.
He was an artiste par excellance, and it was common ground between us.
Rarely, he would produce a piece of exceptional emotion, not as technically
perfect as his other works but so much more honest, and I marveled at the
talent in these.  He was always pleased by my admiration, and over time his
smile came to mean more to me than my father's tears, though both were so
very equally rare.  I suppose that's why I grew to love him, which makes
life all the more bitter now.
It was my twentieth birthday, as I recall, and Father (who still tried back
then) was planning some sort of party.  I, of course, was looking for a way
to avoid his festivities and spoil his plans.  Brand was ever sensitive to
my moods, and saw the fireworks coming.  He suggested a ride in the hills
with a picnic lunch, an endeavor that would keep us out all day.  It was
incongruous, but I was delighted to accept.
We snuck out of the castle while the servants were still clearing
breakfast, our bundles packed tightly and careful to avoid any curious
eyes.  No easy task in Castle Gossip, but it was like an adventure.  A
stable hand saw us go so we were careful to leave in a misleading
direction, and Brand was ingenious at covering tracks.
We rode out into the foothills of Kolvir, the sea and birds the only noise
around.  It stands out in long memory as one of the most peaceful days I
have ever known.  Brand discussed with me the Pattern, asking when I
planned to get over my stubborn streak.  I told him quite seriously that
I'd never give Father the satisfaction while he lived.  Brand nodded
quietly, understanding, and for that more than anything else, my heart was
his.  He seemed himself that day, the moodiness lifted, and we chatted
amiably as we rode.
Gone but two hours, I felt someone trying to reach me by trump.  I
resisted, and it faded, but the effort must have shown on my face for I
felt Brand watching me curiously.  The attempt resumed, stronger, and I
reined in my horse with beads of sweat standing out on my brow.  Distantly,
I felt a hand fall onto my shoulder, and the pressure in my head lessened.
The trump contact faded, and I opened my eyes.  Brand sat his horse very
close to me, his eyes concerned.
"Bleys" he muttered as the touch faded away, but his hand remained.
Exhausted, I slumped on his shoulder.  His initial jerk of surprise was
quickly replaced by a comforting hug.  We sat in silence long minutes, then
with unspoken agreement rode again toward the sea.
The picnic was quiet and restful, and we spent some time enjoying wine and
sharing sketches of the landscape.  After a time I put down my paper and
watched him work.  He seemed almost happy, sharing one of his rare smiles.
The sun slid across the sky, and after some time had passed he showed me
what he was drawing.  It was a picture of me he had drawn, and to my eye it
was far more beautiful than I thought myself to be.  There was something
innocent and child-like to his face as he smiled again at my delight, and
his breath woofed out in surprise at my impetuous hug.  A long minute
passed, but when I started to release him I found he did not let go.  A
hand entwined in my hair, gently, and I turned to look into his eyes.
Curious, I met his gaze, and for once saw no pain, no mockery, just the
crystal green of the morning sea.
Terrified of the consequence, yet unable to help myself, I leaned forward
to kiss him, expecting resistance.  He hesitated but a moment, the small
smile still playing in the corner of his mouth.
        The sounds of sea and sky played a melodic background over the next few
hours as the sun sand and then vanished, and I suppose Grandfather would
have killed us both for how we spent that long afternoon and evening.
        Lying on the cooling sand later with my head in his lap, watching the
stars, he spoke softly, almost shyly,
        "I almost forgot, I brought you a birthday present."
        I laughed, sitting up, "What, another one?" I teased him.
        He rolled over to where his pack was, pulling out a thickly wrapped parcel
and handing it to me.  I settled back leaning against him, unwrapping the
gift.  Inside was soft black fabric, encircling something small and solid.
The fabric unwound into a beautiful black silk tunic, finely made in a
style similar to his own.  Inside that was a hard leather case, black with
gold knotwork engraved all around it.  I glanced up at him in delight.
        "Open it" he urged, seeming a cross of pleased by my reaction, and a
trifle impatient.  I had the feeling our day was coming to a rapid close.
I opened the case and inhaled in surprise, pulling out a full set of the
family's favorite cards.  Father had refused me a set until I walked the
Pattern - a battle of wills we perpetuated.  But these, I could tell, were
fairly newly drawn, and something about them was reminiscent of Brand's
hand, but not quite. =20
        I turned, and leaned over to thank him with a kiss, but something in his
eyes went hard and icy, and I stopped myself.  I knew the wind had changed,
and it was better left alone for now.  Something nagged inside that I was
no longer really looking at Brand, and I shivered slightly and stood up.
Trying to recover, I smiled,
        "It's late, and the air's getting cold.  Maybe we should head back?"
        It wasn't my Brand who shrugged non-commitally, so I started getting our
things together, while he watched me in silence.  Troubled, I finished up,
and we rode away in silence.  I was confused, feeling slightly betrayed at
not even getting a full day, but I held my tongue.  When we reached a spot
just out of sight of the Castle, he grabbed for and jerked my horse's reins
suddenly, startling us both and nearly pitching me to the ground.
        "This is where I leave you" he said curtly, "go home.  We were seen
leaving together, we will not return together."
        "But" I started to protest, "no one saw=85"
        He cut me off instantly, "Always assume you were watched and plan
accordingly."  The ice in his eyes melted just a touch, and he seemed
consumed with his internal struggle.  A hint of sorrow came into his
expression, and I almost winced as he reached out to cup my chin, lifting
my face.
        "I'll be back" he said, "in time.  All things in their time."  I longed to
reach out and hold him, but his eyes shifted, and icy fingers seemed to
trail down my spine.  I wanted to run, but gods help me, it was far too
late.  I had quite completely fallen in love with my Father's younger
brother, and even I realized this was dangerous and futile.  He dropped his
hand, looking like a trapped animal, spun his horse and rode off into the
gathering darkness.  I sat watching him disappear into the gloom, and sadly
turned my horse to home.  I contemplated the quicksilver personality that
was Brand as I rode home, not knowing then that characteristic was to mark
and encompass our relationship over the years.  And over time, it would
only grow worse.
        Father was incensed, which was a pleasant side effect, demanding to know
where I'd been and why I didn't answer his calls.  I smiled enigmatically
at him as I noticed Eric watching speculatively from down the hall.  I
could sense that Father was dying to ask how I resisted his trump calls as
well, but would never do so in front of Eric.  Never one to lose an
opportunity, I moved towards my Uncle, speaking to him as if my father were
not there.
        "I was celebrating my birthday in style.  Would you like to hear all about
it, Uncle?"  I smiled disarmingly at Eric.  His amusement was a tangible
thing as he answered, "Of course, whatever the lady wishes to share".
        I took his arm, very properly, chatting amiably about my ficticious day
shopping and sightseeing as we wandered toward the study without a backward
glance.  I could feel Father seething behind me.  Eric played his part
well, always the gentleman, the amused twinkle still in his eye when I bade
him good night and retired.  It was a day where I'd felt I truly won the
round.

-=> brother, and even I realized this was dangerous and futile.  He dropped his
-=> hand, looking like a trapped animal, spun his horse and rode off into the
-=> gathering darkness.  I sat watching him disappear into the gloom, and sadly
-=> turned my horse to home.  I contemplated the quicksilver personality that
-=> was Brand as I rode home, not knowing then that characteristic was to mark
-=> and encompass our relationship over the years.  And over time, it would
-=> only grow worse.
 
Even when he was the kind, collaberative, helpful individual, he had sort
of a haunted look about him.  He often mentioned the shirt, but never again
mentioned the trumps.
 
-=>     Father was incensed, which was a pleasant side effect, demanding to know
-=> where I'd been and why I didn't answer his calls.  I smiled enigmatically
-=> at him as I noticed Eric watching speculatively from down the hall.  I
-=> could sense that Father was dying to ask how I resisted his trump calls as
-=> well, but would never do so in front of Eric.  Never one to lose an
-=> opportunity, I moved towards my Uncle, speaking to him as if my father were
-=> not there.
-=>     "I was celebrating my birthday in style.  Would you like to hear all about
-=> it, Uncle?"  I smiled disarmingly at Eric.  His amusement was a tangible
-=> thing as he answered, "Of course, whatever the lady wishes to share".
-=>     I took his arm, very properly, chatting amiably about my ficticious day
-=> shopping and sightseeing as we wandered toward the study without a backward
-=> glance.  I could feel Father seething behind me.  Eric played his part
-=> well, always the gentleman, the amused twinkle still in his eye when I bade
-=> him good night and retired.  It was a day where I'd felt I truly won the
-=> round.
 
The next year, you also one ... you set up with Flora in advance your
party, and somehow neglected to tell your father that you had done so.
Somehow Flora also neglected to tell him, and there was a Row between them
over the fact he was trying to distract her staff from doing their jobs,
and making sure nothing was available for him in terms of supplies or
assistance, so he had to import them form out-shadow, and everyon showed up
at your party, while his was woefully unattended.
 
You might want to write about the time that he slapped you and then almost
immediatly took a dagger to himself. (His upper right arm, at the shoulder
joint.  The one he paints with, in the style of your trumpset.)
 
We should also discuss what exactly is in your trumpdeck.

-=> >Eric showed you two places, the place where you were an Agent of Change:
-=> What is the name of the shadow ( or main city in the shadow ) where the
-=> Agents of Change and the Great Council exist?
 
You were never told the name of the shadow by Eric, the planet that you
were based off of (The secret one) was Bennett.  The one the Council used
as their base was Secundus, the alleged source of this spread of humanity
was from a single planet, now called Manhome.  Your POB (Planet of Birth)
listed in the Government Files is New East Odessa, a lovely world, sharing
a single primary with New West Odessa.  You had memorised a few facts from
there, including East had large varients in seasons, the Equatorial strip
is mostly unterraformed, and inmicial to human life, and the
poles/subarctic melt enough for the farming during the late
spring/summer/early fall, and the underground living facilities are used in
the winter.  West was significantly more temperate, with two natural
satelites to adjust it's equitorial tilt more equitably, is mostly a
pleasure planet, supported by the crops grown on East.
 
-=> And what's the other place he showed me?
 
Ahh ... the other place.  Technomancy runs rampant there.  He didn't
deliberately show you that place, but just took you through it, to pick
something up and check on someting else along his way.  You haven't yet
been able to break the screens holding people out, but thhhen again, it
wasn't (at the time) as interesting to you as the place he showed you after
(the one described above) which you ...
 
-=> AND, which one did he tell me not to mention to Bleys, hoping I would?
 
Both, well the entire trip, actually.
 
Be well.

-=> From: Lori JE Turi <lori@mci.net>
-=>
-=> Perhaps the kind and benevolent God would like to see the rest of the
-=> UNFINISHED memoirs?  Your commentaries are most sought after....
 
As always.  Your servant.
 
-=> Excerpts from the Edge: Memoirs of a Reluctant Amberite
-=>
-=>     When I was fairly young, I think about 11, I remember going to Fiona to
-=> learn about shadow and about the Pattern.  From things I overheard some of
-=> my Uncles say at various times, I was intensely curious.  Fi was cautions,
-=> but informative, and to this day I believe she answered my questions pretty
-=> honestly.  We always did get along well.
-=>     Finally, after a long discussion, I asked her to show it to me.  She
-=> suspected, quite correctly, that I intended to try to walk it, but she
-=> didn't betray me.  Knowing how I felt towards my father, she diplomatically
-=> sent a servant to inform Grandfather 'where we were going'.  I grinned at
-=> her, she knew me too well.  I wonder how things may have gone if she'd just
-=> trumped him, but that's under the bridge now.
-=>     I can only surmise that my father somehow overheard or intercepted the
-=> servant's message; I doubt Grandfather informed him.  We were only just
-=> arriving at the great door when Grandfather appeared.  He looked at me
-=> appraisingly, but offered no comment.  Not a big surprise, he was rarely
-=> garrulous with me.
-=>     We entered the room, and as I stood in awe gazing at the Pattern glowing
-=> before me, Fi gave me her instructions and advice, glancing occasionally at
-=> Grandfather.  I listened carefully, getting ready while staring down at the
-=> first terrifying step.=20
-=>     Suddenly, the door was heavily swung open, and I turned to see Father
-=> enter with Uncle Julian in tow.  Fi must have seen me tense, eyes
-=> narrowing, as she stepped over to me and rested a hand lightly on my=
-=>  shoulder.
-=>     Father gestured flamboyantly, "And I almost missed the fun!"  He turned to
-=> Julian with a gloating expression, "Get ready to pay up brother, this time
-=> I will win."
-=>     Julian didn't bother to reply, scowling faintly and crossing him arms over
-=> his chest.  His eyes never left me.
-=>     I started at my father a long moment, hate seething through me.  Fighting
-=> for control, I smiled to him with a voice sweet as sugar, "This would
-=> please you very much Father?"
-=>     Obviously, he had a learning curve.  He eyes were wary as he turned to me,
-=> "It would be a good time to claim your heritage" he answered.
-=>     "Then" I said, satisfied, "I don't want it."
-=>     Julian raised one measured eyebrow, and I caught Fi covering a smile.
-=> Grandfather just scowled.  I turned on my heel, head high, and walked out.
-=> Behind me, I heard words sweeter than ambrosia from Grandfather's gravelly
-=> voice.
-=>     "Bleys, you are three kinds of fool, and none of them good."
                                                                                     
... good.  You want her trapped prepubesent?"
 
-=>     Smiling, I went back to my rooms.  Father stayed out of my hair for a full
-=> three weeks, and I was immensely pleased with myself.
 
... weeks, after he returned from the survey of K'rin's sailors that Oberon
sent him on, and ...
 
-=> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
-=>     I think my earliest memory of my mother was of a soft, gentle voice that
-=> sang so sweetly I wanted it to never stop.  Mommy would always sing to me,
-=> every nap, every night, every morning.  I was only a child, but she was my
-=> entire world and I loved her with the fierce love only a child could feel.
-=> I sensed, in that way children have, that she was unhappy and driven, but
-=> she always had time for me.
-=>     When I was still very little, I remember Mommy came to me one night
-=> without a song.  I was curious, but never frightened around her.  She told
-=> me something wonderful had happened.  She said that she thought she'd
-=> finally found my father, and soon he would come and be with us and we would
-=> all be so happy together.  I was delighted, and began asking her time after
-=> time, day after day, when he'd arrive.
-=>     "Soon, angel, soon" she'd smile at me, humming softly.  "Daddy lives a
-=> long way away, and it will take him some time to come, but I'm sure he
-=> knows all about you now, and how could he not come?"
-=>     I waited for him, and waited, and waited.  To a child, it seemed like
-=> forever, though Mommy insisted it was only a few weeks.  She looked so
-=> tired, so worn out, but she still always had time for me.  I guess I was
-=> almost oblivious, and it wasn't till years later that I realized those were
-=> hard times for us.  Money seemed short, and our customary feasts faded
-=> quite into Spartan meals.  Mommy took great care over my clothes, and I
-=> hardly noticed that her gowns began to look theadbare.  She was dragged
-=> into longer and longer meetings with her counselors.  I was scared of the
-=> raised and angry voices behind those doors, but I'd always hear Mommy's
-=> voice, calm and even, answering them, and I believed I had nothing to worry
-=> about.  How na=EFve are children.
 
You might want to work in the part that tere were always less and less
people around ... Willing volunteers to the blood-magic rites that went on
for his summoning.
 
-=>     Finally came the day that Father arrived.  He rode into the castle
-=> courtyard on a beautiful white horse, and I thought him so wonderful.  I
-=> was in for a harsh lesson in reality.  Father swept in like he owned the
-=> place, and Mommy rushed out to greet him.  He swung down from his horse,
-=> tossing the reins to a nearby servant.
-=>     He glanced at her with a small smile, "Where's my daughter?" he asked,
-=> with no preamble.  Mommy smiled proudly, pointing to me as I rushed forward.
-=>     "Here, Daddy!" I exclaimed, "Here I am."  I ran up to him expectantly.  He
-=> gazed down at me, hands on hips, and I'll never forget that moment.
-=>     With half a glance back at my mother, he quipped, "Not bad.  Prettier than
-=> you.  She'll do nicely."  I heard my mother gasp and looked at her to see
-=> the stricken look on her face.  I was confused, not understanding.  Mommy
-=> had told me we'd be happy now, but she didn't look happy.  Frightened and
-=> unsure, I started to cry.  Father frowned, and picked me up suddenly.
-=> "None of that" he said smoothly, "Princesses don't cry."  He put me back
-=> down, patting me on the head, and turned to my mother.
-=> "Sorry we can't stay" he said shortly, "I just came for the girl.  I have a
-=> very tight schedule."
-=> Mommy looked so sad, with tears in her eyes, "You can't take her from
-=> me=85she's all I have.  I only wanted to share with you what a miraculous
-=> gift we'd been given."
 
-=> Father waved a hand at her briefly, "Get her things together if you think
-=> she'll need them, otherwise, I'll just have to get new stuff for her" he
-=> answered, overriding her.  His expression darkened, "Unless you'd rather
-=> her not have anything of her own."
-=> Without a word, Mommy turned and went back into the castle.  I ran after
-=> her, ignoring my father's call to get back outside.  Mommy went to my room,
-=> and began putting all my favorite things in a bag for me.  I was crying
-=> now, confused, and kept asking her where we were going.  Finally, with a
-=> sigh, she sat on the bed and took me in her arms.  I didn't know it then,
-=> but it was to be the last time she would ever hold me.
 
Hmm ... I don't think Bleys would have wanted you dragging a raggletaggle
of things from some shadow place, when he would, of course, replace them
with real things ... Mommy probably gave you the hug and speech right there,
at the side of the horse, and maybe slipped one of the last pieces of
jewlery off her wrist/ankle/out of her ear/unpinning her hair/off the front
of her gown (whichever suits you better) as a momento.
 
-=> "Angel, Mommy's had you all to herself all this time.  Daddy loves you too,
-=> and you're going to go visit with him for a while.  Then, later, you can
-=> come back and visit with me again.  Doesn't that sound like fun?"
-=> I cried and held on to her, sobbing my heart out, "No Mommy, no, I don't
-=> want to go away from you, don't let him take me away, no!"  My mother held
-=> me and rocked me, singing softly until I fell asleep in her arms.
 
Nah ... he wouldn't have waited that long, some tearful scene, with a
"Right then, we'll be off now." A plucking forth, a last glance through
tear-stained eyes at an ash-colored face and a wooden smile, and the
parting words of "be brave, my little delight".  A whispered word in your
ear, and then blissfull blankness.
 
-=> When I awoke, lots of time must have gone past, because I felt all
-=> light-headed and thirsty.  I was in a strange room, full of strange toys
-=> and things, and it was very big.  The bed wasn't mine either, and the
-=> covers felt scratchy.  Scared and confused, I started calling for my Mommy.
-=>  After a few minutes, a woman came in.  I didn't know her, but she smiled
-=> gently, and sat down on the bed.
-=> "Celeste?  I'm your Aunt Fi.  I'm your daddy's sister.  It's ok" she told
-=> me, "nobody's going to hurt you.  We're all family here."  She smiled
-=> reassuringly at me, and offered a hug.  I clung to her and cried for a
-=> while, asking for my mother.
-=> Under her breath, I heard Aunt Fi mutter, "Damn you Bleys" before she
-=> turned back to me.  "Your mother's fine, dear.  She wanted you to come see
-=> this big castle where your daddy lives.  Won't that be fun?  C'mon, I'll
-=> show you around."
-=> Fiona  was very sweet and kind to me, and I gravitated toward her like I
-=> was drowning and she was my only lifeline. =20
 
That would have been Flora being kind to you.  Fi would have attracted you
later with displays of powers and secrets.
 
-=> I remember quite clearly that for the first few months of my new life in
-=> Amber Castle, I cried myself to sleep every night and often woke up from
-=> terrible dreams that something had happened to my mother.
-=> Years later, when I finally was able to return to my mother's shadow, I
-=> found a derelict castle, a wasted land, and a lonely grave on the hill
-=> overlooking the sea.  The stone erected there read simply:
                                                                                     
Her Royal Majesty Analee the First, of Erelorne
 
Born in the 25th Year of the Reign of Lorena the Fourth on the 9th day of
the 8th month.
 
Began Her Glorious Reign on the first hour of her 20th year.
 
Died in the 12th year of her Reign on the 12th day of the 5th month.
 
Last of Her Line -- Beloved Mother
She passed away in great sorrow
And the country sorrows for her in return"
 
The first three lines were cut with a delicate and precice hand, the rest
by what might be judged a shaken old hand.
 
And, down the hill from the stone, there is another, nowhere near as
ornate, with a simple carving:
 
I was the last, I have buryed my Queen.
She rests above, I rest between.
 
And in front of the stone is a shallow pit, filled with debris and weather,
and, perhaps, the remains of a body, exposed to the elements.
 
-=> >From that day on the cold war between myself and my father escalated into
-=> the deepest pit of hatred I could conjure within myself. I vowed to never
-=> bring him the smallest bit of pleasure and to rob his miserable life of
-=> every joy I could until the day he died.
-=> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
-=> (God's revisions not yet included...)
 
Ok, I'll skip to the next.
 
-=> I always liked Brand.  I'm loathe to admit that I probably started
-=> cultivating a friendship simply because Father was unkindly towards him,
-=> but it's likely true.  That was a simple way to irk father; how could I
-=> pass it up?  It's probably the same reason I always was so sweet to Eric=85
-=> Anyway, after a time I cam to genuinely like Brand.  I don't know, maybe it
-=> was because he seemed more tortured and tragic than I, or maybe because he
-=> was equally alone in Amber.  But I did enjoy his company.  He was a distant
-=> person, and often as not was torn by some inner turmoil he wouldn't share.
-=> Eventually his pain melted the ice in my heart and we grew into one of my
-=> better friendships in Amber, part-time though it was.
-=> He was an artiste par excellance, and it was common ground between us.
-=> Rarely, he would produce a piece of exceptional emotion, not as technically
-=> perfect as his other works but so much more honest, and I marveled at the
-=> talent in these.  He was always pleased by my admiration, and over time his
-=> smile came to mean more to me than my father's tears, though both were so
-=> very equally rare.  I suppose that's why I grew to love him, which makes
-=> life all the more bitter now.
-=> It was my twentieth birthday, as I recall, and Fqther (who still tried back
-=> then) was planning some sort of party.  I, of course, was looking for a way
-=> to avoid his festivities and spoil his plans.  Brand was ever sensitive to
-=> my moods, and saw the fireworks coming.  He suggested a ride in the hills
-=> with a picnic lunch, an endeavor that would keep us out all day.  It was
-=> incongruous, but I was delighted to accept.
-=> We snuck out of the castle while the servants were still clearing
-=> breakfast, our bundles packed tightly and careful to avoid any curious
-=> eyes.  No easy task in Castle Gossip, but it was like an adventure.  A
-=> stable hand saw us go so we were careful to leave in a misleading
-=> direction, and Brand was ingenious at covering tracks.
-=> We rode out into the foothills of Kolvir, the sea and birds the only noise
-=> around.  It stands out in long memory as one of the most peaceful days I
-=> have ever known.  Brand discussed with me the Pattern, asking when I
-=> planned to get over my stubborn streak.  I told him quite seriously that
-=> I'd never give Father the satisfaction while he lived.  Brand nodded
-=> quietly, understanding, and for that more than anything else, my heart was
-=> his.  He seemed himself that day, the moodiness lifted, and we chatted
-=> amiably as we rode.
-=> Gone but two hours, I felt someone trying to reach me by trump.  I
-=> resisted, and it faded, but the effort must have shown on my face for I
-=> felt Brand watching me curiously.  The attempt resumed, stronger, and I
-=> reined in my horse with beads of sweat standing out on my brow.  Distantly,
-=> I felt a hand fall onto my shoulder, and the pressure in my head lessened.
-=> The trump contact faded, and I opened my eyes.  Brand sat his horse very
-=> close to me, his eyes concerned.
-=> "Bleys" he muttered as the touch faded away, but his hand remained.
-=> Exhausted, I slumped on his shoulder.  His initial jerk of surprise was
-=> quickly replaced by a comforting hug.  We sat in silence long minutes, then
-=> with unspoken agreement rode again toward the sea.
-=> The picnic was quiet and restful, and we spent some time enjoying wine and
-=> sharing sketches of the landscape.  After a time I put down my paper and
-=> watched him work.  He seemed almost happy, sharing one of his rare smiles.
-=> The sun slid across the sky, and after some time had passed he showed me
-=> what he was drawing.  It was a picture of me he had drawn, and to my eye it
-=> was far more beautiful than I thought myself to be.  There was something
-=> innocent and child-like to his face as he smiled again at my delight, and
-=> his breath woofed out in surprise at my impetuous hug.  A long minute
-=> passed, but when I started to release him I found he did not let go.  A
-=> hand entwined in my hair, gently, and I turned to look into his eyes.
-=> Curious, I met his gaze, and for once saw no pain, no mockery, just the
-=> crystal green of the morning sea.
-=> Terrified of the consequence, yet unable to help myself, I leaned forward
-=> to kiss him, expecting resistance.  He hesitated but a moment, the small
-=> smile still playing in the corner of his mouth.
-=>     The sounds of sea and sky played a melodic background over the next few
-=> hours as the sun sand and then vanished, and I suppose Grandfather would
-=> have killed us both for how we spent that long afternoon and evening.
-=>     Lying on the cooling sand later with my head in his lap, watching the
-=> stars, he spoke softly, almost shyly,
-=>     "I almost forgot, I brought you a birthday present."
-=>     I laughed, sitting up, "What, another one?" I teased him.
-=>     He rolled over to where his pack was, pulling out a thickly wrapped parcel
-=> and handing it to me.  I settled back leaning against him, unwrapping the
-=> gift.  Inside was soft black fabric, encircling something small and solid.
-=> The fabric unwound into a beautiful black silk tunic, finely made in a
-=> style similar to his own.  Inside that was a hard leather case, black with
-=> gold knotwork engraved all around it.  I glanced up at him in delight.
-=>     "Open it" he urged, seeming a cross of pleased by my reaction, and a
-=> trifle impatient.  I had the feeling our day was coming to a rapid close.
-=> I opened the case and inhaled in surprise, pulling out a full set of the
-=> family's favorite cards.  Father had refused me a set until I walked the
-=> Pattern - a battle of wills we perpetuated.  But these, I could tell, were
-=> fairly newly drawn, and something about them was reminiscent of Brand's
-=> hand, but not quite. =20
-=>     I turned, and leaned over to thank him with a kiss, but something in his
-=> eyes went hard and icy, and I stopped myself.  I knew the wind had changed,
-=> and it was better left alone for now.  Something nagged inside that I was
-=> no longer really looking at Brand, and I shivered slightly and stood up.
-=> Trying to recover, I smiled,
-=>     "It's late, and the air's getting cold.  Maybe we should head back?"
-=>     It wasn't my Brand who shrugged non-commitally, so I started getting our
-=> things together, while he watched me in silence.  Troubled, I finished up,
-=> and we rode away in silence.  I was confused, feeling slightly betrayed at
-=> not even getting a full day, but I held my tongue.  When we reached a spot
-=> just out of sight of the Castle, he grabbed for and jerked my horse's reins
-=> suddenly, startling us both and nearly pitching me to the ground.
-=>     "This is where I leave you" he said curtly, "go home.  We were seen
-=> leaving together, we will not return together."
-=>     "But" I started to protest, "no one saw=85"
-=>     He cut me off instantly, "Always assume you were watched and plan
-=> accordingly."  The ice in his eyes melted just a touch, and he seemed
-=> consumed with his internal struggle.  A hint of sorrow came into his
-=> expression, and I almost winced as he reached out to cup my chin, lifting
-=> my face.
-=>     "I'll be back" he said, "in time.  All things in their time."  I longed to
-=> reach out and hold him, but his eyes shifted, and icy fingers seemed to
-=> trail down my spine.  I wanted to run, but gods help me, it was far too
-=> late.  I had quite completely fallen in love with my Father's younger
-=> brother, and even I realized this was dangerous and futile.  He dropped his
-=> hand, looking like a trapped animal, spun his horse and rode off into the
-=> gathering darkness.  I sat watching him disappear into the gloom, and sadly
-=> turned my horse to home.  I contemplated the quicksilver personality that
-=> was Brand as I rode home, not knowing then that characteristic was to mark
-=> and encompass our relationship over the years.  And over time, it would
-=> only grow worse.
-=>     Father was incensed, which was a pleasant side effect, demanding to know
-=> where I'd been and why I didn't answer his calls.  I smiled enigmatically
-=> at him as I noticed Eric watching speculatively from down the hall.  I
-=> could sense that Father was dying to ask how I resisted his trump calls as
-=> well, but would never do so in front of Eric.  Never one to lose an
-=> opportunity, I moved towards my Uncle, speaking to him as if my father were
-=> not there.
-=>     "I was celebrating my birthday in style.  Would you like to hear all about
-=> it, Uncle?"  I smiled disarmingly at Eric.  His amusement was a tangible
-=> thing as he answered, "Of course, whatever the lady wishes to share".
-=>     I took his arm, very properly, chatting amiably about my ficticious day
-=> shopping and sightseeing as we wandered toward the study without a backward
-=> glance.  I could feel Father seething behind me.  Eric played his part
-=> well, always the gentleman, the amused twinkle still in his eye when I bade
-=> him good night and retired.  It was a day where I'd felt I truly won the
-=> round.
-=>
-=> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
 
This one doesn't seem to have the adds either ... Hmm ... I'll comment
anyway.  (Just SEE if you can stop me ... Bwahahahah)
 
-=> Fondly do I recall my first visit to the shadow world of .  It was an
-=> unplanned excursion resulting from some simple mischief designed to irk
-=> Father.  I had seen him entering the Grand Library, so I shadowed the
-=> hallway waiting for opportunity.  Soon enough it came, in the form of Eric.
-=>     "Uncle Eric" I greeted him enthusiastically, but not too obviously loud,
-=> "I was just looking for you."
-=>     His smile was wary but amused, "And how can I help you?" he inquired=
-=>  evenly.
-=>     "I just hate going out by myself, and I can imagine no better company.
-=> Will you go riding with me?  Please?" I asked sweetly.
-=>     To his credit, he glanced around surrupticiously, eyes searching for the
-=> object of my probably needling.  At the soft intake of breath from the

"I would be remiss if you were not provided with appropriate escort for
your station." (Remember, Eric is the Ambassador Par Excelance in my campaign.)
 
-=> offering his arm.  "Shall we?"
-=>     As we turned to go down the corridor, I sighed.  "Eric, you are my
-=> favorite Uncle.  I only with I'd had you for a father!  Such a shame we
-=> don't get to choose."
-=>     I imagine Eric's light laughter was one of the most bitter sounds Father
-=> ever heard.  I hoped he choked on it.  Both Eric and I were well aware it
-=> wasn't meant, but it was awfully nice of his to play along on occasion.
 
Eric's bitter laughter probably was a point for Bleys ... long story, and
you don't know it in character.  Though you proabably didn't mention it
again in his presence.
 
-=>     My immediate goal attained, I had no idea where I wished to go and Eric
-=> filled in the gap too easily.  I should have been suspicious, but I was too
-=> absorbed inwardly gloating over my latest coup d'etat.  Eric led us down
-=> past Arden and out into Shadow, setting the horses a brisk pace.  He seemed
-=> to have some goal in mind and I was content to follow along, away from my
-=> father and Amber.  Brand was absent again, having left in a foul mood, and
-=> I had little else to do.  I kept careful control of the conversation,
-=> steering Eric casually away from more dangerous subjects and chattering
-=> merrily about clothing, shopping and social affairs.  I was unconcerned
-=> when we went from horseback to some sort of motorized bikes.  Eric knew
-=> what he was doing.  So busy was I monitoring the conversation that I hardly
-=> noticed the shadows stop changing, and our change of clothing.  When he
-=> stopped, I was finally aware and looked around at where we'd arrived.
-=>     I stared around in wonder, not noticing Eric watching me carefully.  We
-=> had just crested a hill, and below us was the most amazing space-port city.
-=>  I saw small hover vehicles zipping through and around the street-ways, and
-=> there were people everywhere.  Their clothing was fantastic, and I let out
-=> a little yelp of delight.  I looked over to notice Eric grinning charmingly.
 
Insert Stopover to Technomancy place here ... Something about refreshing
yourselves along the way, and he had to check on something since you
(plural) were out this way anyway.
 
-=>     "Thought maybe you'd enjoy this place, seeing as you don't get out much"
-=> he drawled, and I winced at the unintended barb.  I certainly never
-=> regretted balking my father's plans, but refusing the Pattern to spite him
-=> was a major inconvenience when I wanted to get away from him...
-=>     Eric took me on a tour of the city, and I loved that place.  We enjoyed a
-=> bizarre yet tasty meal, and I took careful mental notes of many places.
-=> Over lunch, I took the time to sketch a few memorable things, and Eric
-=> merely watched non-committally.  Finally, when we were ready to set out for
-=> home, he turned to me with a very serious expression.
-=>     "Celeste, you must remember not to tell your father I've brought you here,
-=> or shown you this place.  That's very important, will you do that for me?
-=> It would annoy him a great deal."
-=>     Solemnly I promised him that I would not tell.  Eric smiled a little smile
-=> to himself as we started the road back to Amber.  Father was still seething
-=> when we got home, but he restrained himself to just asking if we'd had a
-=> nice time.  I smiled pleasantly, and told him Eric was kind enough to take
-=> me shopping in Begma, then walked away.
-=>     As I turned the corner I glanced back, to see Father talking to Eric, who
-=> was looking after me thoughtfully.  I never did tell Father where Eric took
-=> me, and I believe he was very surprised that I didn't use a weapon he said
-=> would annoy Father.  How could he ever know that the only promises I don't
-=> keep are the ones Father extracts?  Why would I break a promise to Eric?
-=> This family of mine may never truly understand me.
 
-=> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
 
-=>     For as long as I've been able, every May 12th I return to Erelorne, to my
-=> Mother's grave.  That is the anniversary of the day Father killed her with
-=> heartache and loneliness, and I will not let her be alone on that day even
-=> in death.  I always bring flowers and a bottle of wine, and I spend all of
-=> the day there.  I've noted, over the years, that Father never bothers to
-=> come with me, and each year he chooses not to show up is that much more
 
... me, nor has ever asked where I go on that day, and ...
 
-=> fuel on the fires of war.  Someday, perhaps, I will have the pleasure of
-=> dragging his rotting carcass to that spot, and casting it down the hill and
-=> over the sea cliffs below.  He's not worthy of being buried in the same
-=> ground as she, and is barely worthy of feeding the birds on the rocks.
-=>     I do remember one year when dearest Fi went with me.  She seemed to
-=> actually have some sympathy for what Father had put Mother through, and she
-=> wanted to keep me company that time.  I was in one of my blackest moods,
-=> and I suspect she was worried about me.
 
Fi follows in her mother's footsteps, and would only have evidenced enough
sympathy to hook you ... but you might not know that.  Fi taught you how to
teleport, and the room that was yours was probably the first place you went
... you found your mother's bier after exploring the totally unpeopled
place.  Not even a stray dog.
 
Flora probably met you there the first time you went on The Aniversary.
How she knew where to go, or when, you didn't know, and somehow you never
questioned.  She didn't get too close to you, just let you know she was
there if you needed her.  Since you didn't, she han't shown up there again
that you know of.
 
-=>     We talked all day, Fiona and I, and our subjects ranged from family and
-=> friends, to esoterics and magic.  I remember at one point I confessed to
-=> her how very lonely I was, and she was a great comfort as I cried on her
-=> shoulder half an hour.
-=>     She was understanding and kind all that day, never once mocking or
-=> sarcastic to me, and I was so grateful for her company.  Come sunset we
-=> were walking in the ruins of my mother's castle, drinking wine from the
-=> bottle and talking to the ghosts.  Fiona commented on how beautiful it must
 
... to imaginary ghosts. ...
 
-=> have been once.  I suppose I spoke from the heart, though I don't remember
-=> what all I said, for I suddenly realized she was staring at me quite
-=> intently, her attention absolutely riveted.  I slowly stopped speaking,
-=> self-conscious, and asked her what I'd said wrong.  She shook her head, and
 
... I said.  After a while Aunti Fi commented about how I must have really
loved this place.  At my acknowlegement, she then said, "Come, let me give
you a present."  I must have looked confused for she said "Come on," and ..
 
-=> beckoned me to follow.  Mystified, I did.  Mounting up, we rode for a time,
-=> the shadow shifting around us. Eventually we came out of a dark forest into
-=> a meadow clearing to behold an exact copy of my mother's castle in all it's
-=> spender, but constructed entirely of crystalline ice.   Fi's hand rested
-=> lightly on my shoulder,=20
-=>     "This" she said, "is for you."
-=>     I rode towards it as if in a dream, hardly daring to breathe lest it melt
-=> away.  The sea beyond was misty, with a dream-like quality, and the clouds
-=> floated through the sky like cotton candy.
-=>     Ice it might have been, but each room was private from the next, only a
-=> hint of indistinct color showed through each wall.  There were no people
-=> there, for which I was grateful.  I wasn't ready to deal with those sort of
-=> ghosts.  Wind-chimes sounded in the breeze, and it was a place of magic and
-=> beauty.
-=>     In the main hall, I was further delighted to find a roaring blue fire.  No
-=> ice melted, yet it gave off a soft warm glow.  In front of the fire was a
-=> deep fur rug in varigated shades of blue and green, like a polar bear
-=> dipped in dye.  I sank down into the wonderful deep fur to stare into the
-=> flames, and was not really surprised to feel hands kneeding my neck and
-=> shoulders.
 
Sounds good.  I would wish you not to flade to black so early, but each to
their own comfort levels.
 
Let me know what my changes evoke within you.

Perhaps the kind and benevolent God would like to see the rest of the
UNFINISHED memoirs?  Your commentaries are most sought after....
 
 
Excerpts from the Edge: Memoirs of a Reluctant Amberite
 
        When I was fairly young, I think about 11, I remember going to Fiona to
learn about shadow and about the Pattern.  From things I overheard some of
my Uncles say at various times, I was intensely curious.  Fi was cautions,
but informative, and to this day I believe she answered my questions pretty
honestly.  We always did get along well.
        Finally, after a long discussion, I asked her to show it to me.  She
suspected, quite correctly, that I intended to try to walk it, but she
didn't betray me.  Knowing how I felt towards my father, she diplomatically
sent a servant to inform Grandfather 'where we were going'.  I grinned at
her, she knew me too well.  I wonder how things may have gone if she'd just
trumped him, but that's under the bridge now.
        I can only surmise that my father somehow overheard or intercepted the
servant's message; I doubt Grandfather informed him.  We were only just
arriving at the great door when Grandfather appeared.  He looked at me
appraisingly, but offered no comment.  Not a big surprise, he was rarely
garrulous with me.
        We entered the room, and as I stood in awe gazing at the Pattern glowing
before me, Fi gave me her instructions and advice, glancing occasionally at
Grandfather.  I listened carefully, getting ready while staring down at the
first terrifying step.=20
        Suddenly, the door was heavily swung open, and I turned to see Father
enter with Uncle Julian in tow.  Fi must have seen me tense, eyes
narrowing, as she stepped over to me and rested a hand lightly on my=
 shoulder.
        Father gestured flamboyantly, "And I almost missed the fun!"  He turned to
Julian with a gloating expression, "Get ready to pay up brother, this time
I will win."
        Julian didn't bother to reply, scowling faintly and crossing him arms over
his chest.  His eyes never left me.
        I started at my father a long moment, hate seething through me.  Fighting
for control, I smiled to him with a voice sweet as sugar, "This would
please you very much Father?"
        Obviously, he had a learning curve.  He eyes were wary as he turned to me,
"It would be a good time to claim your heritage" he answered.
        "Then" I said, satisfied, "I don't want it."
        Julian raised one measured eyebrow, and I caught Fi covering a smile.
Grandfather just scowled.  I turned on my heel, head high, and walked out.
Behind me, I heard words sweeter than ambrosia from Grandfather's gravelly
voice.
        "Bleys, you are three kinds of fool, and none of them good."
        Smiling, I went back to my rooms.  Father stayed out of my hair for a full
three weeks, and I was immensely pleased with myself.
 
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
 
        I think my earliest memory of my mother was of a soft, gentle voice that
sang so sweetly I wanted it to never stop.  Mommy would always sing to me,
every nap, every night, every morning.  I was only a child, but she was my
entire world and I loved her with the fierce love only a child could feel.
I sensed, in that way children have, that she was unhappy and driven, but
she always had time for me.
        When I was still very little, I remember Mommy came to me one night
without a song.  I was curious, but never frightened around her.  She told
me something wonderful had happened.  She said that she thought she'd
finally found my father, and soon he would come and be with us and we would
all be so happy together.  I was delighted, and began asking her time after
time, day after day, when he'd arrive.
        "Soon, angel, soon" she'd smile at me, humming softly.  "Daddy lives a
long way away, and it will take him some time to come, but I'm sure he
knows all about you now, and how could he not come?"
        I waited for him, and waited, and waited.  To a child, it seemed like
forever, though Mommy insisted it was only a few weeks.  She looked so
tired, so worn out, but she still always had time for me.  I guess I was
almost oblivious, and it wasn't till years later that I realized those were
hard times for us.  Money seemed short, and our customary feasts faded
quite into Spartan meals.  Mommy took great care over my clothes, and I
hardly noticed that her gowns began to look theadbare.  She was dragged
into longer and longer meetings with her counselors.  I was scared of the
raised and angry voices behind those doors, but I'd always hear Mommy's
voice, calm and even, answering them, and I believed I had nothing to worry
about.  How na=EFve are children.
        Finally came the day that Father arrived.  He rode into the castle
courtyard on a beautiful white horse, and I thought him so wonderful.  I
was in for a harsh lesson in reality.  Father swept in like he owned the
place, and Mommy rushed out to greet him.  He swung down from his horse,
tossing the reins to a nearby servant.
        He glanced at her with a small smile, "Where's my daughter?" he asked,
with no preamble.  Mommy smiled proudly, pointing to me as I rushed forward.
        "Here, Daddy!" I exclaimed, "Here I am."  I ran up to him expectantly.  He
gazed down at me, hands on hips, and I'll never forget that moment.
        With half a glance back at my mother, he quipped, "Not bad.  Prettier than
you.  She'll do nicely."  I heard my mother gasp and looked at her to see
the stricken look on her face.  I was confused, not understanding.  Mommy
had told me we'd be happy now, but she didn't look happy.  Frightened and
unsure, I started to cry.  Father frowned, and picked me up suddenly.
"None of that" he said smoothly, "Princesses don't cry."  He put me back
down, patting me on the head, and turned to my mother.
"Sorry we can't stay" he said shortly, "I just came for the girl.  I have a
very tight schedule."
Mommy looked so sad, with tears in her eyes, "You can't take her from
me=85she's all I have.  I only wanted to share with you what a miraculous
gift we'd been given."
Father waved a hand at her briefly, "Get her things together if you think
she'll need them, otherwise, I'll just have to get new stuff for her" he
answered, overriding her.  His expression darkened, "Unless you'd rather
her not have anything of her own."
Without a word, Mommy turned and went back into the castle.  I ran after
her, ignoring my father's call to get back outside.  Mommy went to my room,
and began putting all my favorite things in a bag for me.  I was crying
now, confused, and kept asking her where we were going.  Finally, with a
sigh, she sat on the bed and took me in her arms.  I didn't know it then,
but it was to be the last time she would ever hold me.
"Angel, Mommy's had you all to herself all this time.  Daddy loves you too,
and you're going to go visit with him for a while.  Then, later, you can
come back and visit with me again.  Doesn't that sound like fun?"
I cried and held on to her, sobbing my heart out, "No Mommy, no, I don't
want to go away from you, don't let him take me away, no!"  My mother held
me and rocked me, singing softly until I fell asleep in her arms.
When I awoke, lots of time must have gone past, because I felt all
light-headed and thirsty.  I was in a strange room, full of strange toys
and things, and it was very big.  The bed wasn't mine either, and the
covers felt scratchy.  Scared and confused, I started calling for my Mommy.
 After a few minutes, a woman came in.  I didn't know her, but she smiled
gently, and sat down on the bed.
"Celeste?  I'm your Aunt Fi.  I'm your daddy's sister.  It's ok" she told
me, "nobody's going to hurt you.  We're all family here."  She smiled
reassuringly at me, and offered a hug.  I clung to her and cried for a
while, asking for my mother.
Under her breath, I heard Aunt Fi mutter, "Damn you Bleys" before she
turned back to me.  "Your mother's fine, dear.  She wanted you to come see
this big castle where your daddy lives.  Won't that be fun?  C'mon, I'll
show you around."
Fiona  was very sweet and kind to me, and I gravitated toward her like I
was drowning and she was my only lifeline. =20
I remember quite clearly that for the first few months of my new life in
Amber Castle, I cried myself to sleep every night and often woke up from
terrible dreams that something had happened to my mother.
Years later, when I finally was able to return to my mother's shadow, I
found a derelict castle, a wasted land, and a lonely grave on the hill
overlooking the sea.  The stone erected there read simply,=20
=20
"Her Royal Majesty Analee of Erelorne
Beloved Mother
August 29, 430 - May 12, 462
She passed away in great sorrow
And the country sorrows for her in return"
>From that day on the cold war between myself and my father escalated into
the deepest pit of hatred I could conjure within myself. I vowed to never
bring him the smallest bit of pleasure and to rob his miserable life of
every joy I could until the day he died.

Beautiful ... you seem to have just the right feel for it ... one minor

-=> We rode out that day, Brand and I, on the pretense of some shopping I
-=> wished to do.  Our frequent excursions drew tight, white-lipped glares from
-=> Fi these days, so I decided it best to come home with plenty of packages.
-=> If she had but a reason to suspect the truth, it would go badly for us
-=> both.  Thankfully, we had done nothing to draw Grandfather's attention=85yet=
-=> .
-=> Crowds were sparse that day, and I purchased a few things quickly - enough
-=> to divert Fi.  I was careful not to let Brand see me purchase two bolts of
-=> velvet, one in black and the other in a rich hunter green.  I wanted to
-=> surprise him with a new tunic and jacket.  I guess I was happy and not
-=> paying enough attention to have let down my guard so badly.  And the wine
-=> at lunch surely didn't help, fine vintage though it was.  I didn't notice
-=> how noncommittal he'd grown till far too late.
-=> We rode down to the seaside after eating, for I loved the ocean.  Brand
-=> followed my lead slowly.  Jumping enthusiastically from my horse, I
-=> discarded my excess clothing, which is to say most of it, and dove into the
-=> water.  Rising, I noted he was still standing on the shore, looking at me
-=> in a way that should have rang alarm bells, but I was too giddy to take
-=> note.  In retrospect, so many things are clearer=85
-=> Playfully, I scooped up water and splashed him as I drew closer, intending
-=> to throw my arms around him and drag him into the fun.  His lip curled in a
-=> vicious snarl; too late to check my momentum I saw him pull his arm back to
-=> strike.
-=> Funny thing about the children of Amber - even the least warrior-like among
-=> them can deliver a blow that will kill a lesser creature.  Fortunately, I
-=> too am a child of Amber.
-=> Brand's blow caught me across the side of the face and temple, and I could
-=> taste blood before I hit the sand.  I was certain my lip was split, and I
-=> was contemplating the possibility of a concussion from the ringing in my
-=> ears when I heard the inarticulate howl behind me.  Truly alarmed now, I
-=> spun to ward off the incoming attack only to see Brand fighting with
-=> himself.  He had a dagger drawn, and before I could intercept him had
-=> stabbed himself in the right shoulder.  In my mind flashed incongruous
-=> connections, that it was the hand he struck me with and also the hand he
-=> painted with when he did put image to paper.  Horrified, I saw the dagger
-=> sink into the joint and Brand collapsed to his knees on the beach.
-=> I was screaming when I reached him, blood running down my chin mixing with
-=> his blood in the sand.  Strong he was, but I was desperate to keep him from
-=> injuring himself further.  I struggled with him until he stopped fighting
-=> and he collapsed on me sobbing incoherently.  My heart was broken at his
-=> pain, and I tried to comfort him as best I could.  I wasn't even angry
-=> about the blow, that was the funny thing, but I couldn't convince him for a
-=> long time.  It would be months before he would meet my eyes, at least as
-=> himself.
-=> I tended to the shoulder as best I could, eventually using some of the
-=> green velvet to bind it up.  Once he noticed what I was doing, started to
-=> ask where it came from, then realization must have struck him for he
-=> collapsed crying again.  Never before, and never again, did I ever see him
-=> in such a state, and it shook me to the core.
-=> It was almost two and a half hours later when we rode into Castle Amber.
-=> The servants were alarmed, and it seemed only minutes before Gerard strode
-=> into the courtyard, serious and stern.  He spared but a glance for the two
-=> of us, shook his head, and physically man-handled Brand to the infirmary.
-=> I started to wander off, dazed, but Gerard quickly dispelled any notions
-=> that I would escape his attentions as well so I followed meekly.  I vaguely
-=> recall Flora holding one arm and murmuring platitudes and comforts.  I
-=> suppose she was trying to help.
-=> Brand mumbled deliriously several times that he didn't mean it and it
-=> wasn't his fault, and Gerard's scowl deepened each time.  His gaze reached
-=> me, and I could almost see the gears turning.
-=> "You will explain to me what happened" he rumbled ominously.  I nodded
-=> mutely, too dizzy and exhausted to argue.  While I sat watching him tend
-=> Brand, I noticed Father slip into the room.  He watched in silence for a
-=> long moment, pursed his lips thoughtfully, then left as quietly as he came.
-=>  I worried about that for a long time, but a comment never was made.
-=> When Brand was resting comfortably, Gerard turned to me.  While he was
-=> seeing to my minor injuries (it was a fractured jaw and a minor concussion,
-=> I learned, not to mention a badly blacked eye.  Not bad Brand, not bad) he
-=> tried to contain himself with difficulty.  Finally, he exploded, "What the
-=> hell happened to you two?"
-=> The wheels in my mind turned over and over, and went blank.  I couldn't
-=> think of a single thing.  Stumbling over my words, I told Gerard about a
 
... blank.  It was as if my brain was frozen in ice.  I heard my lips
moving and telling some convincing tale about certain brigans, who attacked
us while we were out on a shopping expidition.  They had hit me ..
 
 
-=> ride down past the docks, and something hitting me blindside.  I never saw
-=> it coming, I told him, and when I came to, there was Brand knifed on the
-=> ground.  I wasn't really sure what had happened I assured him.  I'm certain
-=> he never believed a word of it, nor did anyone else.  But it was as good an
-=> explanation as they ever got, and neither I nor Brand ever mentioned it=
-=>  again.
 
... asured him.  My voice went on to describe them with the depth and
accuracy that would have been apropriate, and, at the same time, I could
almost see them myself.  When Gerard was finished ministering to our
wounds, he left us with explicit instructions to "Stay and rest, I'll be
back."  Brand was vacillating between overconfident and apologetic. Neither
I nor Brand ever mentioned it again.

-=> A few things...
-=>
-=> 1) Where I said Fi and Cel were walking through the ruined castle talking
-=> to the ghosts, I meant it in the 'ghosts of the past, ghosts that haunt the
-=> mind/spirit' kind of way, not in a literal sense (I was being poetic,
-=> dammit) so I'm leaving it stand as written.  It is, after all, from her
-=> point of view, and she's writing this, not me :-)
 
Granted.  I just wanted to make sure that you knew this place (unlike
others you might end up in) did not actually have ghosts.  It can stay
lyrical.  I am just providing the underlying facts, you don't have to keep
my wordings, and, well, my spellings are not very precice. (as you might
have noticed)
 
-=> 2) I have a segment between Celeste and Julian that I hate.  It's
-=> awful...it's not even good writing.  So...  the basic premise is that
-=> Celeste is still irked over Julian being willing to bet with Bleys (as far
-=> as she knows) all those years ago.  Bleys seemed to have some drive to best
-=> Julian (to her eye) but couldn't, so she wants to get even with Julian and
-=> her father in one shot by one-upping Julian to pay him back, and in doing
-=> so do something Bleys couldn't.  She's a bit driven, you see.  I figured to
-=> the point where eventually she'd go to Arden and, if allowed, learn to
-=> hunt, but I don't know where to go from there.  The ORIGINAL concept for
-=> Celeste had her seducing Julian just once, BUT in this version I can't see
-=> it.  This is a slightly different minded Celeste, with a much more
-=> vulnerable seeming Brand.  She just wouldn't, not even to strike out at
-=> Bleys.  So...  I'm looking to you for ideas on where to go with this
-=> concept.  What I have now is just drivel.
 
Hmm ... You might want to talk to Zacharias, something about getting him
(Julian's Son, but a nice person despite it, and older than you) to teach
you to hunt, maybe discover here that he is actually a decent person, and
is somewhat embarassed by his father.  Perhaps a colaberative piece?  He is
nuric@haven.org, but he doesn't read his mail all that often, you might
want to send mail to barb@mitlns.mit.edu to get her to needle him into
reading mail.
 
-=> 3) Mmmm...can I have some more detail on the general appearence of the
-=> technomancy shadow we passed through?  I hate being vague.  IF this is
-=> someplace well established, if not I'll be happy to ad lib.
 
It was just a stopover point.  I don't want to give away too much
information ... but think of what a high level technomancy place would be,
ruled by a fairly strict, but benevlent overcompany.
 
-=> Also, when Eric took her to Bennett/Secundus/Manhome shadow...WHERE did
-=> they go?  Which planet?  Did he just show her New West Odessa, or New East
-=> Odessa, or hop between all of them?  How would he travel between them?
-=> Would he bother utilizing proper in-shadow transport and protocol or just
-=> Pattern hop from place to place? I need some sort of feel on Eric, other
-=> than his charming personality and gentlemanly habits....
 
He is there a high-level courier for a powerful bank.  He uses the local
transportation where possible.  The "transfer in" point is on Secondus, and
he takes you to New West Odessa for the shopping and the culture.  When you
go back you also start on Secondus, and ... well ... have to take less
savory means of aquiring access to transport.  Maybe that's where you
picked up the taste for mass murder?
 
-=> That should do for the first round this morning.  I AM happy, though I'm
-=> missing this Tuesday, that I will as compensation have plently of time to
-=> get Celeste well established in mind and history before bringing her into
-=> the campaign.  It's nice not to have to rush.
 
I don't like rushing my players either.  The first three or four of the
original game sessions was just for like purposes.  Backfill, historical
role-play, connecting player's pasts, and the like.  From such a skilled
player like yourself, I would expect no less.

Well ... let's see:
Benedict might be
Osric won't be
Finndo won't be
Bridget won't be
Eric through Random might be
You won't be  (you never sat for a formal trump portrait, usually only
               happens after your patternwalk)
Mirelle won't be (she didn't for the same reasons)
and then you were handed the deck.  So the younger ones would have to be of
your own crafting.
 
Teleport usually only works across shadow.  You would have trouble bouncing
between places within the same shadow, without a gate elsewhere first.

Hmm ... a short time after she thought to do so, and a little before she
actually did so, Aunt Flora (_not_Fi_) gave you a kerchif as a gift.  You
might have neglegently shoved it in a pocket.  Later when you went
exploring, it was still in your pocket, and you had no troubles with
anything in the room.  Perhaps at a later time, when you didn't have
Flora's little keepsake in your pocket, you couldn't get in passed the open
door.  I'll leave it to you if you connect the two events.

I'll have to check the timing and all ... but I believe that's accurate.

Not always ... sometimes they are extreemly insightful into the character
...  for example, just after those moments of bliss on his part, you
traditionally keep your eyes closed, because you don't like what is looking
out from his, for those brief moments.  Or perhaps there are styles in and
of yourself, that you might mention, deliberately without mentioning the
partner in question.  It gives good insight.  You might also want to look
at my Quizes for rounding out purposes.  They are:

-=>  Far more interesting (to

-=> to call for it.  Dunno, fanatics, go fig.
 
Indeed, that also has alure.
 
-=> Anyway, I lied.  Here's another Brand segment.  Your thoughts?
-=> Have I gotten a feel for the possessed little psychotic yet?
 
I think so.  It seems to fit for all.  Nice touch with the ash.
 
-=> Flora insisted, when I was still a teenager, on teaching me how to sew.  I
-=> was studying by this time with Fiona on occasion, and I recall looking at
-=> her incredulously.
-=> "Why bother?" I asked, quite honestly.
-=> Flora put down her work and looked at me for a long moment, though I felt,
-=> at the time, she was looking more through me than at me.  Finally, she
-=> answered slowly, and her words stuck in my memory as well.
-=> "Sometimes it's useful, sometimes it's novel, sometimes it's just something
-=> to do.  But most of all, it's good to create something yourself, with your
-=> own talent and your own hands.  It's a good feeling, and it's one I want
-=> you to know."  It was, likely, the deepest thing Flora ever said to me, and
-=> it impressed itself upon me very strongly.  With those words as a preamble,
-=> I learned to sew at Flora's tutelage, and have never regretted the lessons.
-=> Years later, when I was sitting and sewing for lack of anything else to do
-=> in between Grandmother's teachings, I would think of those words and smile.
-=> But more specifically I recall the year I attempted to create for Brand a
-=> gift to match the tunic he had once given me.  Buried in my closet I had
-=> several bolts of beautiful velvets and silks, accumulated over time, and I
-=> decided to put them to good use.
-=> With Flora's help (though I never specifically told her whom I was making
-=> it for) I designed a riding outfit and jacket that I was sure he would
-=> like.  It took some time to make, but again Flora came to my rescue.  I
-=> remember her commenting once on the colors I'd chosen with a sidelong
-=> glance, but I paid it no attention and she let it go.  Flora always was
-=> kind to me.
-=> The entire outfit took me almost 3 weeks to finish to my satisfaction, and
-=> it really was quite nice.  I was finished almost a full month before his
-=> birthday, but I determined to wait.
-=> The week before that day, Brand slipped out of Amber with no warning.  Not
-=> uncommon for him, but I had the uneasy feeling he wouldn't be back for a
-=> while.  He'd been acting very edgy the past few days, and I'd seen the
-=> storm coming.  Guess it couldn't keep.  I waited until he didn't show up,
-=> then on the eve of his birthday I decided it couldn't be too bad an idea to
-=> just trump him.  I knew better, sure, but I don't think I ever showed much
-=> sense when it came to Brand.
-=> He answered slowly, and I heard his voice before the picture came alive.
-=> "What do you want Celeste?" asked a not-quite-Brand voice, and then the
-=> image came clear.  Through the mist behind him I could vaguely make out a
-=> desolate, rocky place that somehow conveyed an image of heat and ash and
-=> lava.  That feeling of doom choked me again, and I stammered in reply.
-=> "It's... your birthday.  I had... well... I wanted to give you... I
-=>  made a gift..." my
-=> voice faded out on it's own accord, his eyes bored into mine like icy
-=> daggers.  There was something in them not right, and it seemed almost an
-=> effort for him to acknowledge me.
-=> "This... couldn't wait?" he asked, his voice almost a hiss.
-=> That's when I grew angry, irrational though it was.  I was intruding on
-=> him, and I damn well knew better.  But temper runs true.
-=> "No, dammit, it couldn't wait!  Can't you be just a little gracious when
-=> someone's being nice to you?!"
-=> A shadow of fury crossed his face, and I nearly recoiled in alarm.  The
-=> connection snapped into place and grew solid, and winds of hot ash blew
-=> through the card, burning my cheeks.  He lifted one hand toward me, fingers
-=> curled, and I started to mentally backpedal.  Desperately I looked back
-=> into his eyes for a clue, and stopped at the changing expressions there.
-=> Fear, hate, love, terror, but most of all pain flashed through his eyes in
-=> the infinite space of seconds, and I decided with no rational thought that
-=> the only way out was to trust and not struggle.  I stood very still, just
-=> meeting his gaze with no resistance, and somewhere in his eyes was just a
-=> touch of surprise, or maybe regret.  He grimaced as if in great pain,
-=> wrapping his arms around himself, and the connection not so much broke as
-=> shattered.  The migraine lasted me a week and a half.
-=> I went back to his room and gently laid the gift out on his bed, then left
-=> silently leaving no note or trace.  He would understand.  As before, he
-=> never spoke to me of that again, but he did thank me for the gift, and I
-=> saw him wearing it often.
-=> I noted once he was wearing those clothes on his way out, and walked by
-=> where I stood speaking with Flora.  She glanced up and nodded to him, then
-=> resumed our conversation without comment.  She never paused or hesitated,

-=> In light of recent discussions regarding Secundus, etc, here's a revised

-=> planning more detail for a later segment.
 
It seems to flow seamlessly here ... with the one comment below ...
 
-=> Fondly do I recall my first visit to the shadow world of New West Odessa
-=> and Secundus.  It was an unplanned excursion resulting from some simple
-=> mischief designed to irk Father.  I had seen him entering the Grand
-=> Library, so I shadowed the hallway waiting for opportunity.  Soon enough it
-=> came, in the form of Eric.
-=>     "Uncle Eric" I greeted him enthusiastically, but not too obviously loud,
-=> "I was just looking for you."
-=>     His smile was wary but amused, "And how can I help you?" he inquired=
-=>  evenly.
-=>     "I just hate going out by myself, and I can imagine no better company.
-=> Will you go riding with me?  Please?" I asked sweetly.
-=>     To his credit, he glanced around surreptitiously, eyes searching for the
-=> object of my probably needling.  At the soft intake of breath from the
-=> direction of the Library door, he relaxed, eyes twinkling merrily.
-=>     "I would be remiss if you were not provided with appropriate escort for
-=> your station" he smiled, offering his arm.  "Shall we?"
-=>     As we turned to go down the corridor, I sighed.  "Eric, you are my
-=> favorite Uncle.  I only with I'd had you for a father!  Such a shame we
-=> don't get to choose."
-=>     I imagine Eric's light laughter was one of the bitterest sounds Father
-=> ever heard.  I hoped he choked on it.  Both Eric and I were well aware it
-=> wasn't meant, but it was awfully nice of his to play along on occasion.
 
Hey!  I thought I had pointed a fix to this.  Eric has no known children
for a reason ... and any mention of same would bring only bitter laughter,
not delight.
 
-=>     My immediate goal attained, I had no idea where I wished to go and Eric
-=> filled in the gap too easily.  I should have been suspicious, but I was too
-=> absorbed inwardly gloating over my latest coup d'etat.  Eric led us down
-=> past Arden and out into Shadow, setting the horses a brisk pace.  He seemed
-=> to have some goal in mind and I was content to follow along, away from my
-=> father and Amber.  Brand was absent again, having left in a foul mood, and
-=> I had little else to do.  I kept careful control of the conversation,
-=> steering Eric casually away from more dangerous subjects and chattering
-=> merrily about clothing, shopping and social affairs.  I was unconcerned
-=> when we went from horseback to some sort of motorized bikes.  Eric knew
-=> what he was doing.  So busy was I monitoring the conversation that I hardly
-=> noticed the shadows stop changing, and our change of clothing.  When he
-=> stopped, I was finally aware and looked around at where we'd arrived.
-=>     I stared around in wonder, not noticing Eric watching me carefully.  We
-=> had just crested a hill, and below us was the most amazing Spaceport City.
-=> I saw small hover vehicles zipping through and around the street-ways, and
-=> there were people everywhere.  Their clothing was fantastic, and I let out
-=> a little yelp of delight.  I looked over to notice Eric grinning
-=> charmingly.  He waved a hand at the cityscape below,
-=>     "Just here for a quick stop, this isn't quite where I had in mind, but I
-=> hope you don't mind if I take care of a little business on the way through."
-=>     He looked at me as if my opinion really mattered, and I got the distinct
-=> impression that if I protested, he would actually change his plans.  I was
-=> overwhelmed, and told him of course I didn't mind.  To this day I wish I
-=> had insisted on seeing more of that place.  He didn't even tell me the name...
-=>     I did take note of the extraordinary and exotic variety of creatures
-=> moving about the streets.  The concept of streets is almost a misnomer, as
-=> there seemed to be as much air as ground traffic, and ground was on several
-=> levels.  It all formed a blur in my mind, and Eric took care of his
-=> business quickly and efficiently enough for me not to even note what went
-=> on.  My impressions of the place are clear but jumbled, and I never have
-=> managed to get back there.  Not for lack of trying though.
-=>     Eric finished up quickly, and then we were off and out again, this time
-=> using some form of shuttlecraft to shift though shadows of galaxies and
-=> space stations.  My head swam, and I stared out the windows like a tourist,
-=> I'm afraid.
-=>     Finally, he arrived in orbit around a huge planet, and began chatting
-=> amiably with the powers that be for the spaceport below us.  Clearance
-=> established, we maneuvered in to land.  Eric turned to smile at my
-=> wide-eyed, gaping stare, and patted me kindly on the hand.
-=>     "Thought maybe you'd enjoy this place, seeing as you don't get out much"
-=> he drawled, and I winced at the unintended barb.  I certainly never
-=> regretted balking my father's plans, but refusing the Pattern to spite him
-=> was a major inconvenience when I wanted to get away from him.       My travels
-=> with Eric that day taught me a few things.  It was the first time I enjoyed
-=> being an Amberite, and enjoyed being able to see different worlds like no
-=> others could.  Eric gave me back a little joy in my life.  But most of all,
-=> it reinforced how much I hated my father.  Not being able to find places
-=> like this was a promise he drove me into, and I blamed him entirely.  But
-=> I'd sworn my vow before my mother's grave, and to Brand, and it's said the
-=> dead cannot forgive.

-=>     "Celeste, you must remember not to tell your father I've brought you here,

-=> It would annoy him a great deal."
-=>     Solemnly I promised him that I would not tell.  Eric smiled a little smile
-=> to himself as we started the road back to Amber.  Father was still seething
-=> when we got home, but restrained himself to asking if we'd had a nice time.
-=>  I smiled pleasantly, and told him Eric was kind enough to take me shopping
-=> in Begma, then walked away.
-=>     As I turned the corner I glanced back, to see Father talking to Eric, who
-=> looked after me thoughtfully.  I never did tell Father where Eric took me,
-=> I believe he was very surprised I didn't use a weapon he said would annoy
-=> Father.  How could he ever know that the only promises I don't keep are the
-=> ones Father extracts?  Why would I break a promise to Eric?  This family of
-=> mine may never truly understand me.

-=> Benedict        Eric
-=> Corwin          Caine
-=> Deirdre (ahem)  Fiona

-=> Gerard          Julian
-=> Random          Zack
-=> Mikail*         Celeste* (n copies?)
 
where * indicates not by Brand.  Probably by you.
 
Have you decided who taught you?  Aunti Fi and (the thing within) Brand,
and Bleys (the only known trump artists) all do pattern trump, and you
couldn't learn that without pattern.  There is a teacher floating around,
that Clarissa could have introduced you to.  His name is Darkstar.  He is a
Demon from the courts, but has been exiled for some reason.  (Game
mechanic, he is the one who taught Dworkin about Trump, he is the current
Master of that Power/Pole.) Also (as a game mechanic) if you are going to
take Trump, it should be a secret power (as in, you don't go around
displaying it openly) at Brand's advice.
 
Before you were using trumps to get around, you were opening "Shadow Gates"
to places, that you could remember stronly enough (which is why sketching
them helps)
 
-=> I'll work out places shortly, unless you have any changes to this?

Just those noted, in terms of authorship.

-=> 1.Has Celeste been back to Amber since Patternfall? or is the intro into
-=> the game her first return 'home'?
 
Well ... her intro might be her return "home" I believe currently she is
hunting "Caine"s
 
-=> 2.I'm assuming she has SOME clue about how things turned out.  Where did
-=> she find out? Who told her? How much detail did she get? Who told her that
-=> her father had a funeral for her? Who told her Caine shot Brand?
 
How did she find out about her own funeral?  Something along the lines of:
 
"Celeste, M'dear, come here.  I want to teach you how to use the Tower
Crystal to look beyond."  <Insert Teaching>  "Now you try ... here is a
nice place to try to look to."  <Front row seats for your casual,
dismissive funeral>.
 
For Pattern-Redraw?  You had finished your tutelage, and she had sent you
off to Manhome's shadow (a place where the only magic was what you brough
with you) to hone your skills under adverse conditions (and to give you a
bit of vacation) while she dealt with Mikail.  You were contacted by her
via the G-d Channel, asking if you would mind coming "home" and minding her
tower for her while she dealt with some difficulties in person.  You, being
the good worshiper that you are, were more than willing.  While sitting
there, somewhat bored, you were playing around with scrying, and noticed
there was less and less space you could scry to, until all that was left
was the battle at the courts.
 
You watched the non-combatant encampment defended successfully by Zach and
his Ghostly Warriors.  You saw the Amberite Standoff.  You were the only
one to watch Brand as he fell, watch the transform from Ice to Brand, and
heard his last words.  A breathed sigh of relief and the words "At last."
 
-=> 3.Did anyone clean out Brand's rooms in your Amber? Is anything left in
-=> there? (and I do mean anything, down to the smallest details).
 
Brands rooms are still unenterable.  No one has cleaned or cleared them.
Nothing has changed about them since he left.
 
-=> 4.Am I driving you nuts yet?
 
Nah, this is what I live for.  The creative thrust of people.  I at times wish
I could do it fulltime, instead of on the side, without sacrificing any of
the other comforts I have grown to love and depend on.

Indeed, Clarissa would have had to feel her out, find if she was worthy of
Clarissa's time, and then make the "take it or leave it" offer.  Let's see
... Hmm ... Ok, Aunti Fi is teaching you all the special skills that she
can, to try to woo you away from Brand's company (Game Notes: She wants you
as her puppet/card-in-the-hole, not Brand's and she knows you will never be
your father's.)  One time when she was trying to teach you precice control,
she let you begin a "Open gate, and push through quickly" manouver, usually
used in defence, and then, at the last instant, pumped a huge amount of
power into you.  You ended up, instead of at your destination, in front of
a sign that read "Lost?  Have you tried Hari Krishna?"  After a long,
heartfelt shout of disgust ... You were stuck in that shadow for a while,
until you could build up enough power to reach out to a place you knew, and
then could get back from.  The band playing in the church befriended
you. <Insert cover persona here> During your stay there, a somewhat
familiar looking redhead (perhaps a shadow of Fi?) befriended you.  While
you were somewhat unscrupulous in collecting the ancient artifacts that you
could bleed power out of, she was always willing to assist you.  Even to
the point where you betrayed her to get out of a really sticky situation.
                                                                                     
The second time was when you had snuck off to one of your father's G-d
Worship shadows when you knew he was going to be busy and uninteruptable,
with the intent of destroying it.  You found another person there (looking
a lot like the shadow of Fi that you betrayed) starting a counter-religion,
as it's prophet, and she invites you to join her "As prophesized" and
colaberated with you on the prophesies, to make them ambiguous enough, so
you two could get away with just about anything.  Your somewhat careful
questions (especially since she resembled someone you betrayed) led you to
believe that she objected to the female slavery part (and, the reason why
you picked this one, is because for them the "perfect female slave"
description matched you ever so closely, for some odd and unknown reason
...) and was overthrowing the places, to combat the repression.  Since you
both seemed to resemble the perfect slave, people seemed to hold you in
awe, and were more than willing to follow you two.
 
She set the pace, torturing priests with delight and abandon, twisting
things so they suited her, building people up just to tear them down, at
one point, having an entire town put to death by stoning, because "they
bothered her, on some level."  After you two were successful she set you up
to be martyred, with the comment, "You have the means to make this look
good without getting hurt."  Never had she refered to your cross-shadow
abilities until then.
 
The third time ...
 
Well ... the third time ... you had stirred up some mage against you, and
you were fleeing from him, cross shadow, by teleport gates.  You had
stopped somewhere fairly magical rich, to make a stand, when you heard a
voice behind you saying "This will never do."  Sure enough, you wheel
around to see the same readhead.  As you are about to unleash towards her,
your opponent apears, and begins his attack.  Before you can respond, the
readhead casually waves her hand, and he disapears, the air around him
disapears, the ground under him melts and fuses into glass, and there is a
wave of superheated air expanding outward.  You use some of your build-up
potential shielding yourself.  She continues speaking as if nothing had
happened. "It's just too tracable.  It'll get her killed needlessly.  Do
you think you can do anything for her?"  The rock she is sitting on speaks
up.  "I can try, she seems to have enough power at her disposal.  Did you
see what she had prepaired to take him down?  Not the most tidy, but still
... it makes a point nicely.  Will you introduce us?"  And the redhead
replies with "Darkstar, this is my Granddaughter Celeste. Celeste, this is
a good friend of mine, and a master of Trump, Darkstar."
 
Darkstar is a genial helpful individual, somewhat introspective, who has a
large tendency to get dragged into things.  He is a meticulous teacher,
extreemly patiend, and a master shapshifter.  His standard form is somewhat
chitinous, dark blue-black human-sized bug.
 
-=> And, how long before he went totally off the deep end did Brand take off
-=> from Amber?  I figure, that would have been the most logical time for
-=> Celeste to take off with Clarissa...  at the very least I would have to
-=> surmise he wasn't around Amber...then again, I doubt saying no to Clarissa
-=> is anything she'd consider anyway...so...
 
Umm ... Lesee, Darkstar, being a Chaos Demon, let it be know that he didn't
really want to be out Amberways, nor interact with more Amberites than
necessary, so, you were spending chunks of time in shadow learning from
him.  Your fathers comments about how you will catch your death out there
without pattern to help fueled your trips/stays that much more. (And that
is why his epithat for you was basically, "Oh well, I told her so.")  You
met Brand out and about then.  When Darkstar conveyed Clarissa's offer, you
asked him (DS) not to let her (C) know that he (DS) had told you yet.  You
then met with Brand, and he (B) encouraged you to take advantage of it, for it
probably wouldn't be offered again, and he (B) wished he (B) had taken
advantage of it when it was offered to him.
 
-=> How did Celeste wind up going off with Clarissa?  What circumstances would
-=> have surrounded and prompted that?
-=> I don't know enough about your Clarissa to fiction that one.
 
After the nod from Brand, you told Darkstar that you would accept.  He
looked distant for a moment and then said "Done."  Your tutalage with him
continued, somewhat more sporatically, since you were bound to Clarissa's
home shadow for the first span of your ... training.
 
Does that begin to fill in the gaps?
 
-=> [See, you said only three questions was a bad sign
 
It would have been a bad sign, but I'm glad you got over it.
 
-=> , and you'd have to try
-=> harder...sorry you said that yet?
 
Not in the least.  I'm most pleased that you have chosen to join my campaign.
 
-=> Am I driving you insane yet?
 
Some would say you are several years too late.  I would say that this is
simply delightful.
                                                                                     
-=>  Rich used
-=> to look like he was developing an ulcer when I'd submit stuff to him...]
 
Poor Rich.  Still haven't heard from him yet, though.  Personally?  I
prefer lots of interesting background, and formative pieces, it makes the
folk that much more real.

-=> How vicious is your Fiona?  and does/did she dislike or hate Brand?
 
She respects his power, and plots against him.  She is too close to see the
changes, as anything more than him plotting back.  She doesn't like to be
viewed as cruel, but has no morals or scruples.  She already usurped the
throne once by forgery, guile, and the title of regent.  Her mother always
had a tendency to test to the point of destruction, and she has picked up
some of that habbit.
 
She doesn't hate, for hate is distracting.  She is a calm, passionless
(yeah, right, but she tries) opponent, theoretically able to even
appreciate good moves against her.
 
She stabbed him out of fear, near the end, for she had begun to suspect he
was no longer playing the game by the rules.  And woried she was going to
be a pawn sacrifice.  A lowly shadow move.

Subject: yet another segment
To: dkap@bbn.com, dkap@haven.org
 
Incorporating the scene from the book, your cosmology changes, and your
email notes, I've tried to create a version of the last scene at
patternfall from Celeste's point of view.
 
Let's see what you think of it:
 
Some of my finest, if most difficult, memories were of the years I spent
under my Grandmother's tutelage.  Most of that time I won't put to paper;
somehow I feel it would be a violation of contract, even if no one else
will ever read this book.  Unless I'm dead, of course...perhaps I'll leave
it to Aunt Flora as a token of thanks.  But I digress.  I was speaking of
memory, and of my darkest memory from which springs so many nightmares and
so much hate.  And so much regret...
I was in Manhome, a shadow world poor in magic, being that any I used there
had to be what I'd brought along with me.  Grandmother had sent me on
vacation, as it were, to practice under annoying and dangerous conditions
as well as to give her time for some other projects.  Actually, I was
enjoying my stay, and getting quite good at various methods of manipulation.
Without warning, Grandmother contacted me, explaining that she had
something she had to 'deal with' in person right away, and would I come
'home' and mind the tower for her?  Of course I agreed at once.
She left almost immediately, with no explanation (not that I'd expected
one) and I was left to watch over things.  This grew old very fast, and out
of boredom I went to the tower.  My first thought was to check on my grave
and see if it was undisturbed or visited.  I noted the complete absence of
flowers with some mirth, then went on to look at mother's grave.  It was
the same as when I'd last left it, so with a sigh I took to reading and
scrying alternately out of boredom.
Finally, it became apparent something was very wrong out in shadow.  Places
to scry were almost shrinking, and fewer and fewer places were actually
there to look at.  Facinated, I kept at it for hours, probably days, until
I came to the heart of the problem.
It seemed that everyone who was anyone had migrated to the Courts, where
there was a massive battle tide sweeping across the plain?...I think it was
a plain...rather confusing would be a better name for it.  As I scanned
across the milling hordes and rushing figures in the flashing uncertain
light, I caught sight of my cousin Zack.  He was in an area that was
blatantly an encampment for non-combatants, but was still under attack.
His ghostly warriors were holding the attackers at bay, but I began to feel
uneasy.  If Zack was there, that meant...there.  Benedict, leading the
armies, of course.  We seemed badly outnumbered down there, and I could
only hope that whatever Grandmother had gone to take care of, it at least
wasn't aiding the enemy.
I continued to scan, now looking for family in specific, when I caught
sight of Corwin, trying to be furtive.  Frowning, I watched him sneak up
into the cliffs, so I scanned across the area to see what he was up to.
That would be the point I think my heart froze.
Brand stood at the edge of a cliff, the Abyss yawning behind his back and
the Jewel of Judgement pulsing near his throat.  Circling him in were half
a dozen people, Random and Fiona among them.  Numbly I saw he had Dierdre
pulled close in front of him, a dagger's edge pushed cruelly into her
throat and it's path marked by a thin line of blood.  I focused in on that
group intently, now paying attention to sound as well and cursing the
insurmountable distance between us.
Random turned slightly towards Fiona, his voice soft, "Is there nothing
more you can do, Fi?" I heard him ask.
"I can hold him here", she answered, "and at this range, I can slow his
efforts at weather control.  But that is all.  He's got some attunement
with it and I do not.  He also has proximity going for him.  Anything else
I might try, he can counter.  But without the Jewel, we're dead.  That's
the only thing that might hold back the stormfront."
I saw Random gnaw at his lip, edgy.
Brand spoke to them then and ice crawled up and down my spine at the sound
of that voice, that not-quite-Brand edge to his words.  His eyes were cold
and vicious, and I shuddered to see him like that again.
"Put down your weapons" he called to them.  "Do it now or Dierdre's dead."
"Kill her" Random called back "and you lose the only thing that's keeping
you alive.  Do it, and I'll show you where I'll put my weapon."  I heard a
low hissing sound, and it took a moment to realize it came from my own throat.
Brand was muttering to himself, his eyes glazed in that look of
self-argument I''d learned too well.  "Okay.  I will start by mutilating
her" he countered.
Random spat.  "Come on!" he said.  "She can regenerate as well as the rest
of us.  Find a threat that means something, or shut up and fight it out!"
I saw Brand go still, in that inner, contemplative way that was so
dangerous to deal with.  I gritted my teeth, searching for some way to
reach out to him through the crystal.
"I think we're going to have to rush him and chance it" Random said.  "I
don't see anything else.  Do you?"
Brand smiled viciously at them.  "There's nothing you can do.  Throw down
your weapons, surrender, then get the hell out of here.  Or keep them and
get out, I do not care.  Leave me alone, I have things to do."
"Brand" I heard Fiona's voice, taking on that tone she used when she wanted
you to do something distasteful, "can you turn the storm aside from us?"
"I could if I would" he answered her, "yes, I could turn it aside."
"You will be a hero if you do" she continued, smooth and sinuous.  "You
will earn our gratitude.  All past wrongs will be forgiven.  Forgiven and
forgotten.  We..."
Brand's laughter was wild, hysterical, and I flinched.  Fiona never
realized, it was years and years too late for that and even so, she had it
backwards.
"You forgive me?" he said.  "You, who left me in that tower, who put the
knife into my side?  Thank you, sister.  It is very kind of you to offer to
forgive me, but excuse me if I decline."  Knife?  The bitch knifed him?
"All right" Random tried, "what do you want?  An apology?  Riches and
treasure?  An important appointment?  All of these?  They are yours.  But
this is a stupid game you are playing.  Let us end it and go home, pretend
it was all a bad dream."
I sighed.  Random had no clue.  Those things might amuse, but what I
suspected Brand might want Random and Fiona couldn't grant.
"Yes, let us end it" I heard Brand saying.  "You do that by throwing down
your weapons first.  Then Fiona releases me from her spell, you all bend
knee and swear fealty.  Do it or I kill Dierdre."
Random's patience seemed to have snapped, "Then I think you had better go
ahead and kill her and be ready to fight it out with me" he said, "because
she will be dead in a little while anyway, if we let you have it your way.
All of us will".
Again, Brand laughed in that other voice, and it was then I started to cry.
 "Do you honestly think I am going to let you die?  I need you - as many of
you as I can save.  Hopefully even Dierdre.  You are the only ones who can
appreciate my triumph, my loyal subjects.  I will preserve you through the
holocaust that is beginning."
"You're lying" Random stated.
"Think about it" Brand challenged him, "I will be King in Amber by your
accord, and I will want each and every one of you there to obey me.  In
that sense, I require your survival.  Now stop this nonsense and comply."
I noticed Corwin still inching forward, still concealed by this time.
Trump did not seem to be working, and I cursed with tears running down my
face for lack of a way to warn him.
Corwin's face took on a look of concentration, and I saw Brand jerk
stiffly, as if fighting again.  Dierdre reacted, twisting suddenly to grab
for the Jewel.  Brand jerked again, drawing the dagger across her throat
and arm, and I saw blood spurt down her armour.  Her fingers twined about
the chain, which tensed and strained as he convulsed again.  There was a
flash of brilliant silver, and to my horror I saw he had been shot through
the throat.  A quick glance revealed the archer, Caine (damn his soul),
just loosing a second shot.
I looked to Brand, seeing the second shot take him in the chest.  Both he
and Dierdre totter on the edge for what seemed and eternity, then I saw him
falling.  The chain snapped free in Dierdre's grip, and Brand fell towards
the Abyss.
The image that haunts my dreams, my nightmares, is those last few seconds.
His face, his eyes _changed_ again, the cold viciousness gone, and there
was _my_ Brand again.  A sigh, just a whisper, escaped his lips,
"At last..." as he fell, and I could not take my eyes from him.  For just
one last word to him...
        I know I watched him fall, and I felt the touch of gibbering madness begin
to grip my mind even as the blackness welled up around me.  I heard someone
screaming "No!", the voice sounding somehow like my own, and then the
shadows claimed me.
The first thing I noticed, as I awoke, was the smell of some strong herb.
The smell was rapidly followed by the calm, yet somehow concerned, gaze of
Grandmother.  As I strained to focus on her, she smiled in a gentle way, "I
know I warned you not to push so hard, Celeste dear.  You had some fall to
hit your head as hard as you did."
I remember opening my mouth to answer her, when it all hit me in a wave of
pain.  I'm certain in the midst of my hysterical crying I babbled, as much
as I'm sure I called his name.  All I remember was Grandmother's touch,
soft and cool on my forehead, and the blessed darkness claimed me again.
In all, I was out of it for a few days.  When I was permitted out of bed, I
tried to talk to her about it, talk my way out of it, but she saved me the
trouble.
"People say the strangest things in fever dreams, Celeste, and you've been
quite ill" she waved a hand at me dismissively, then looked at me sharply.
her eyes very intense.  "I would put it right out of my head if I were you
dear.  Just forget all about it, alright?"
I got the message loud and clear.  But I certainly wouldn't forget; not
then, not now, not ever.  I still owe Random and Fi a thing or two, and
Caine will suffer the pain of all of my nightmares.
And even now, I love him still.

-=> Ok, I definately want your thoughts and revisions on this one....not sure if
-=> you'll approve of this version of Fiona.  I know I've got the Brand attitude
-=> down pretty well...let's see how I'm doing with Fi.
 
Close ... let's see if we can get it closer.
 
-=> For as long as I've been able, every May 12th I return to Erelorne, to my
-=> Mother's grave.  That is the anniversary of the day Father killed her with
-=> heartache and loneliness, and I will not let her be alone on that day even
-=> in death.  I always bring flowers and a bottle of wine, and I spend all of
-=> the day there.  I've noted, over the years, that Father never bothers to
-=> come with me, nor has he ever even asked where I go on that day, and each
-=> year he chooses not to show up is that much more fuel on the fires of war.
-=> Someday, perhaps, I will have the pleasure of dragging his rotting carcass
-=> to that spot and casting it down the hill and over the sea cliffs below.
-=> He's not worthy of being buried in the same ground as she, and is barely
-=> worthy of feeding the birds on the rocks.
-=> The first year I ever went there, I was somewhat surprised to see Flora
-=> there as well.  I didn't remember ever telling her about it, and I had no
-=> idea how she'd known.  I was curious when she didn't approach me, but seemed
-=> to hover just out of the way.  I finally realized she was there for support,
-=> and I was grateful though I wanted to be alone.  She stayed the whole day,
-=> leaving, I suppose, when I did, though I never saw her go either.  I never
-=> noticed her there again.
-=>     I do remember one year when dearest Fi went with me.  She seemed to
-=> actually have some sympathy for what Father had put Mother through, and she
-=> wanted to keep me company that time.  I was in one of my blackest moods, and
-=> I suspect she was worried about me.
-=>     We talked all day, Fiona and I, and our subjects ranged from family and
-=> friends, to esoteric and magic.  I remember at one point I confessed to her
-=> how very lonely I was, and she was a great comfort as I cried on her
-=> shoulder half an hour.
-=>     She was understanding and kind all that day, never once mocking or
-=> sarcastic to me, and I was so grateful for her company.  Come sunset we were
-=> walking in the ruins of my mother's castle, drinking wine from the bottle
-=> and talking to the ghosts.  Fiona commented on how beautiful it must have
-=> been once.  I suppose I spoke from the heart, though I don't remember what
-=> all I said, for I suddenly realized she was staring at me quite intently,
-=> her attention absolutely riveted.  I slowly stopped speaking,
-=> self-conscious, and asked her what I'd said.  After a while Fi commented
-=> about how I must have really loved this place.  I nodded slowly, and she
-=> answered, "Come, let me give you a present."  I must have looked confused,
-=> for she said "Come on" again, and beckoned me to follow.  Mystified, I did.
-=> Mounting up, we rode for a time, the shadow shifting around us. Eventually
-=> we came out of a dark forest into a meadow clearing to behold an exact copy
-=> of my mother's castle in all it's spender, but constructed entirely of
-=> crystalline ice.   Fi's hand rested lightly on my shoulder,
-=>     "This" she said, "is for you."
-=>     I rode towards it as if in a dream, hardly daring to breathe lest it melt
-=> away.  The sea beyond was misty, with a dream-like quality, and the clouds
-=> floated through the sky like cotton candy.
-=>     Ice it might have been, but each room was private from the next, only a
-=> hint of indistinct color showed through each wall.  There were no people
-=> there, for which I was grateful.  I wasn't ready to deal with those sorts of
-=> ghosts.  Wind chimes sounded in the breeze, and it was a place of magic and
-=> beauty.
-=>     In the main hall, I was further delighted to find a roaring blue fire.  No
-=> ice melted, yet it gave off a soft warm glow.  In front of the fire was a
-=> deep fur rug in variegated shades of blue and green, like a polar bear
-=> dipped in dye.  I sank down into the wonderful deep fur to stare into the
-=> flames, and was not really surprised to feel hands kneading my neck and
-=> shoulders, but I felt myself tensing in uncertainty.
-=>     "Relax" a voice whispered in my ear, strong hands moving to massage my
-=> neck.  Soft lips began to caress the side of my neck and every muscle tensed
-=> in response like a frightened rabbit.
-=> "Relax" the voice suggested again and with a touch of horror I felt my body
-=> comply for me.  My eyes betrayed my inner panic, reflected in her smile, as
-=> she worked her way to my lips with a kiss that was deep and probing.  Her
-=> hands slid up the material of my thin blouse, kneading and teasing my
-=> nipples erect with an expert manipulation.  I shuddered and heard a soft
-=> moan escape my lips as my body rebelled against my mind.
 
You may want to give insight as to perhaps this is what happens when the
Icy look takes over on Brand.
 
-=> I tried to whisper no, but a warm blanket of calm descended over me, fuzzing
-=> my thoughts and rendering me immobile.  My face flushed hotly as I struggled
-=> internally for control and failed, while her lips slid down to join her
-=> hands under my blouse, licking and teasing in calculated expertise.  White
-=> hot bolts of fire raced down my spine.  Her hands moved to my shoulders,
-=> gently guiding me down toward the soft fur of the rug.  My resistance was a
-=> barely noticable hesitation.
 
Aunti Fi doesn't just make love with her body, she brings her powers into
it.  "Fingers" decending on every place they should to relax, and then to
excite.
 
-=> My mind whirred in a chaotic jumble.  It was Fiona's teachings that allowed
-=> me to escape Amber, escape my father, without walking the Pattern.  Fiona's
-=> unfinished teachings.  It was Fiona to whom I had to turn to continue to
-=> learn sorcery.  Well, Fiona or Father, which was no choice at all, really.
-=> I couldn't afford to alienate her now.
 
Somehow, every time you try to think it through, how good Fiona has been to
you starts welling up in your mind.
 
-=> And then there was Brand.  Rebuking Fi now would only lead to closer
-=> scrutiny of what I was doing.  More narrow stares when I slipped out with
-=> Brand, perhaps even surveillance.  My choice, assuming I had one, was grim.
-=> Betray him now, or possibly betray us for good.  But if Fiona thought my
-=> she'd win the round...
 
At that thought, Fi's attentions became redoubled
 
-=> All this flashed through my mind in an instant, and I closed my eyes as she
-=> pushed me softly down.  I let my mind wander, insulating myself in images of
-=> Brand.  His hesitant, almost-shy embraces, his gentle touch, the soft almost
-=> child-like wonder in his eyes when he was truly himself.  Brand's cautious,
-=> pleasant laughter, in those rare moments when he felt free enough to let go.
-=> I thought also of how he was never rough, never forceful, and tears came to
-=> my eyes.
 
Somehow, your reverie caused her touch to become diminished ...
 
-=> Realization slowly dawned that Fi was sitting quietly near me, the weight of
-=> her gaze almost palpable.
-=> "What are you thinking about?" she asked, in a voice like silk and
-=> moonlight.  "You seem...distant."
-=> I opened my eyes, blanking my mind like a door slamming shut from a sudden
-=> gust of wind.
-=> "I was surprised" I answered her slowly, carefully.  "I never knew."
-=> Fiona smiled, like a snake with a small bird.
-=> "I just" she purred, stroking my hair, "wanted to share a moment of
-=> closeness with you.  To show you that you can trust me" she concluded.
-=> Startled, I realized we were both still fully dressed.  I had been so intent
-=> on blocking out what was going on I hadn't realized that most of the input
-=> was sensory, not physical.  I felt a brief moment of panic, wonering how far
-=> into my thoughts she'd gone.  Almost as if I'd spoken aloud, she responded
-=> to my train of thought.
-=> "Of course, you realize it was all pleasure, there was no invasion of
-=> privacy made.  I would not give you reason to hate or fear me.  I only
-=> showed you that I can be a friend to you."
 
That phrase rang like a bell in your mind, like it was completing something
... closing a link.  At the same time ...
 
-=> I stammered something inarticulate, feeling the jaws of a trap closing
-=> around me as if I were suffocating.  Before I could answer, her hand pulled
-=> away and she rose smoothly.
-=> "Shall we?  It's getting late."  She extended a hand to help me up and
-=> wordlessly I accepted.  She spirited us home with no effort and saw me to my
-=> room.  I was bid goodnight with a gentle kiss, left to find my own confused
-=> way to bed.
 
Good so far.
 
-=> Come breakfast the next day, I found myself seated to Fi's right, to my
-=> distress and further confusion.  As I joined the far too full table, Fiona
-=> reached out and took my hand in a companionable but unmistakably possessive
-=> manner.  Not to make a scene, I smiled tightly.  Father glanced at us
-=> briefly, one eyebrow raised in a slightly bitter smile.  Brand stared
-=> fixedly into his coffee and I felt a lump in my throat at Fiona's enigmatic
-=> smile.
-=> I sat quietly through breakfast, eating sparsely and avoiding the curious
-=> glances of various relatives.  Fi finished her eating and her patter of
-=> conversations.  She leaned over as she rose, offering me a warm yet
-=> possessive kiss.  My cheeks flushed and, almost involuntarily, I glanced up
-=> at Brand.
-=> His eyes briefly met mine, and I was looking into a mirror.  They were
-=> equally sad, equally trapped.  A flash of insight, and I knew right then
-=> that he understood and that there was nothing to regret or forgive.  That
-=> moment told me more than any other that, had we any options, things would be
-=> very different with us.  And mostly, I knew then that he felt for me what I
-=> felt for him.
-=> Brand's eyes shifted to Fiona's departing back, and I saw the shift to
-=> something cold and inscrutable.  For the first time, it didn't give me chills.
 
Let me explain how dining works in the castle.  There is High Table, which
seats as many as will sit there, usually ambassadors, and Oberon.  Benedict
usually "sits" on a perch just above and behind Oberon.  The rest of the
people at high table are usually ambassadors, and Flora.  Most of the rest
of the family has a tendency to sit where they will in the rest of the
hall, served along with the rest of the castle staff, luminaries, visitors,
et al.  Sitting at High Table tends to attract attention to you. There are
no fixed mealtimes, so you would have arrived, probably prearranged with
Brand or the like.
 
She probably waited till you were seated, and then joined you ...
 
Of course, instead of a kiss, when she sat down next to you, she triggered
her "excite partner" spell on you.  Nothing physically visible to others,
but to you ... well ... it was a wave, and then gone.  As if a memory.
 
Brand, of course, noticed.
 
Beyond that ... Well Fi is usually the long-term calculating kind.  Somehow
after that, while as emotionally pleasureable Brand was, it was never quite
the same physically ...

-=> Eighteenth birthday party segment:
-=> You will likely have changes, as I don't know if you want your Bleys to
-=> react quite like this.  I kind of imaged this as his last attempt to
-=> reconcile with his daughter in any way, and the last straw that drove him
-=> nearly flawlessly unflappable. =20
 
Naw ... This was just a set of movies to bring you back into his camp, and
reestablish his control over you ...
 
But somehow  ... you and Flora turned the tables on him ...
 
-=>     My eighteenth birthday was a wild success, beyond anything I could have
-=> hoped for.  It's Aunt Flora I have to thank, for she turned out to have a
-=> undercurrent of devious spite almost as strong as mine.  It made me regret
-=> ever being unkindly towards her, and perhaps that was her goal all along ... to
-=> feed a little humble to me.
 
As far as you could tell, she was just wanting what was best for you, and
also, a little bit of a dig to Bleys, becasue he didn't invite Flora to be
part of planning a function that was to take place in "her Demense".  She
evidenced no other malace ... just wanted it to be your best birthday ever.
 
-=>     Aunt Flora approached me months ahead of time, quite enthusiastic over the
-=> idea of planning a gala event for my birthday.  I never did have the heart
-=> to turn her down, and besides, it sounded fun.
-=>     She began organizing her plans to combine the party with a formal ball.  I
-=> begged her to make it a masquerade ball, and she was delighted with the
-=> thought too.  I'd long been fascinated with the concept, and wheels were
-=> already turning in my head.  Aunt Flora said I just _couldn't_ see the
-=> decorating theme ahead of time, but I could choose one favorite thing for
-=> the banquet table.  I've always loved exotic desserts, so I naturally
-=> requested my version of cherise jubilee, with cherries, strawberries, kiwi
-=> and chocolate crepes.  If you've never tried it, I tell you, you've never
-=> lived.
-=>     The parts of the planning I _was_ allowed in on we mostly did up in Aunt
-=> Flora's rooms (where her scheduling books were readily available).  And I
-=> can't help but wonder, in retrospect, if dear Aunt Flora didn't do that
-=> quite intentionally as well.
-=>     The party was still over a month away, when Father approached me after
-=> dinner one evening.  He took my arm as I was leaving the Hall, asking me to
-=> come speak with him in the study.  Surrupticiously noting the number of
-=> curious glances behind us, I shook my arm free distastefully.
-=>     "I suppose" I sighed loudly, sounding as put out as possible.  Several of
-=> the glances turned to smiles and I had to cover my own.  Father, a genial
-=> grin pasted on his face, acted as if he hadn't noticed.  I suspected him up
-=> to something.
-=>     We reached the study in a moment and I sprawled across an overstuffed
-=> chair, affecting a bored expression.  Father blithely poured a drink,
-=> ignoring my attitude and gazing at me with a patient smile.  Curiousity
-=> piqued, I sat up slightly.
-=>     "Celeste dear" he began slowly, "I an aware that we don't always see eye
-=> to eye on things, but I intend to do something nice for your birthday.  It
-=> would" he added dryly "be appropriate if you showed up."
-=>     I looked at him quietly, inwardly gleeful.
-=>     After a few moments, he broke the silence.  "_Will_ you?" he asked warily.
-=>     "All you had to do was ask Father" I purred.
-=>     He looked skeptical, I'll give him that, but he nodded to me.
-=>     "Good" he said, "the rest will be a surprise.  That will be all."
 
Hmm ... the conversation in the library ack's you as much more of an equal
than he would at that point in time.  He would probably wax enthusiastic
about the plans for your comming of age party, and how you would, of
course, be walking the pattern at it's height, and, how HE was going to
throw your pattern party, not Flora ... and he has your trump sitting all
planned ... filling you in on your role, when you were going to get fitted
for your dress, the whole nine yards ...
 
-=>     Thus summarily dismissed, I went back to my room.  Somehow, I just forgot
-=> to mention the conversation to Aunto Flora.  Guess it simply slipped my
-=> mind.  Aunt Flora wouldn't let me in on the rest of her plans, and it
-=> turned out she was damn good at hiding detail.  I waited impatiently for
-=> everything to play out.
-=>     Only a week before my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised to hear Father
-=> and Aunt Flora arguing near the study.  Creeping closer, I evesdropped for
-=> a moment.
-=>     "You will not commondeer my staff!" Aunt Flora was saying hotly.  "They
-=> have their own duties, and I will not have one of my affairs ruined."
-=>     "Sister, be that as it may, I have certain requirements to be met.  I have
-=> every intent of making my own plans perfect, and the resources available
-=> here..."
-=>     Aunt Flora cut him off in a huff.  "Get you own staff Bleys.  And stay out
-=> of the ballroom!  I have it scheduled for that day."
-=>     Father dropped the reasonable voice, "What the hell are you planning
-=> that's so important I can't have a few people to lend me a hand?"
-=>     Aunt Flora actually sounded smug, "It hasn't been announced yet, and I
-=> won't spoil it just for you.  The answer is no.  My staff is busy, and my
-=> affairs take precedence."
-=>     Father stormed out of the study, not even noticing me in the shadows.
-=> Smiling, I ran off to Brand's room to tell him about the fight.  We were
-=> busy coordinating our masquerade costumes that day anyway, as we had a few
-=> plans of our own.
-=>     The day before arrived, and Father was off in shadow somewhere, doing gods
-=> know what.  Aunt Flora made the announcement for her Masquerade Ball, and
-=> invitations were all delivered precisely according to her schedule.  She
-=> confided in me that absolutely _everyone_ had promised to come, and I had
-=> to hide a snicker.  Excitedly, I scampered back upstairs to put the
-=> finished touches on our outfits.
-=>     As the evening of the big party arrived, I had the unique pleasure of
-=> having two servants arrive within 10 minutes of each other.  The first told
-=> me that my father was expecting me in the back gardens.  The second said
-=> Aunt Flora sent word it was time to make an appearance at the Ball.  I
-=> donned my mask (which was a likeness of Athena's owl) and went to the
-=> ballroom immediately.  Just for fun, I stole around to a window overlooking
-=> the gardens.  Father had had the garden decorated beautifully, and there
-=> seemed to be the makings of a fabulous party.  The only people I saw there,
-=> however, were servants.  Smiling, I went downstairs.
-=>     The Ballroom was stunning, even Aunt Flora had outdone herself this time.
-=> Mythological creatures from dozens of shadows cavorted and played up and
-=> down the walls in lifelike renderings.  It seemed as if there were 200
-=> people in the hall, and I was amazed at Aunt Flora's thoroughness.  There
-=> were ice  and fire sculptures of fabulous creatures, and in the center of
-=> the room a beautiful ice fountain of a Unicorn, bathed in soft blue
-=> lighting.  It was breathtaking.
-=>     I slipped into the room quietly, and found Aunt Flora after half an hour
-=> of searching.  She had a truly spectacular mask of a figure I wasn't sure I
-=> was familiar with. =20
-=>     "Thank you" I whispered to her, "it's so beautiful.  Thank you so much."
-=>     The mask turned to regard me for a moment, then her voice floated out.
-=>     "Of course dear, I am so glad that you're pleased.  Now go have fun."
-=>     I turned to go, and I thought I heard her say, though I couldn't be sure,=
-=> =20
-=>     "Isn't it fun how you can't tell who's who."
-=>     I turned to look back at her, but she had melted into the crowd, on the
-=> arm of a large man with the mask of a minotaur.  Thoughtfully, I wandered
-=> away.
-=>     I was enjoying a dance with Brand, later identified only by his mask of
-=> the faces of Cerberus
 
He had doens something to his ... for lack of better word, charisma or

-=> , when a commotion broke out near the door, disrupted

-=>     "...I don't care, just tell me where the hell she is!"  Heads turned, and
-=> I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Father's face vaguely flush.
 
Flora would be there in an instant, berating him, and shending him from the
hall with the line "How DARE you enter my costume ball without a costume!"
First you had the GALL to throw a party on the same day I was, then DEMAND
that my staff assist you. I gave you the COURTISY of not inviting you,
so you wouldn't feel obliged to abandon your own pitiful efforts, in
deference to a party of my design, and you decide to try to CRASH my party,
WITHOUT a proper costume!"  Someone in a "Gerard" costume would drift
towards the pair stairing at each other, and stand so he is subtly backing
Flora's position.  Bleys looks like he is about to do something, and then
backs down, whirls, quipts "You haven't heard the last of this!" and
leaves.  Later rumor through the party mentions that the one word the
costumed "Gerard" said was "chamberpots" ... there was much speculation
what that codeword meant.
 
-=> Brand's
-=> hand tightened protectively on my arm as Father's gaze swept the room.  I
-=> started moving toward the banquet table, unaware that everyone else was
-=> still and I was attracting attention instead.  Father's gaze fell on me
-=> speculatively, as if measuring up whether or not it was me
 
This still could have happened just before the exchange above., but Flora
would not throw her guest of honor to the wolves this way.  The below would
have had to have happened after the party.  You might have asked Gerard to
sit in on the discussion between Flora and Bleys ... not mentioning your
part in it until after he agreed ...
 
-=> and he started
-=> forward.  Someone had the band start playing again, to cover up an
-=> embarrasing scene I suppose, and a low murmur of conversation kicked in.
-=>     Father caught up with me at the banquet table, and I heard a low hiss of
-=> anger as Brand moved out of the way.
-=>     "Celeste, is that you?" he asked, his voice pitched low and controlled=
-=>  again.
-=>     "Yes Father. How nice of you to come" I answered sweetly.
-=>     "You gave me your word you would attend the party I planned for you.  You
-=> deliberately lied to me" he said, dangerously low.
-=>     "On the contrary, Father" I stepped slightly back, "I never promised
-=> anything.  I said you had but to ask.  You took that as my agreement.  It
-=> was your misinterpretation, not mine.  Besides" I waved my hand about, "how
-=> could I dissappoint Aunt Flora after she went to all this effort?"
-=>     I'd never seen father's face turn scarlet before, and I was actually
-=> frightened for a moment.  He started to raise a hand as if to strike, and
-=> almost magically we were both flanked by others.
-=>     I glanced around to see Aunt Flora and that large man in the Minotaur mask
-=> on either side of me, just as I noticed Brand lay a hand on father's arm.
-=>     The Minotaur, in the voice of Uncle Gerard, rumbled, "That would be an
-=> unfortunate decision Bleys."
-=>     Aunt Flora sniffed, "And extremely inappropriate in front of all these
-=> people."
-=>     Father glanced at the Cerebus masked figure holding his arm, frowned
-=> slightly, and nodded.
-=>     "We will discuss this later" he snapped at me, and stormed out.
 
To here.
 
-=>     Feeling faint, I allowed my brave rescuer another dance.  I danced, very
-=> properly with Uncle Gerard as well.  I may have shared a dance with Eric,
-=> though I never was quite sure if it was he behind the mask. Guess I'll
-=> never know.
 
You knew you had danced with Eric, for, near the end of the dance, he
mentioned that "Little Bleys will someday bite off more than he can chew,
and I'll be there to hand his teeth back to him ..."  This is when you
began to suspect how Eric felt about Flora.
 
-=>     I heard a rumor later that the Cerebus masked young man was seen feeding
-=> me flaming cherries while I was laughingly recounting the whole incident,
-=> but you know how rumors get.  Father didn't speak to me for weeks, and I
-=> suppose he decided to just let it go.  Too bad.
 
Hmm ... what about the announcing the cause of the party, of course after
Bleys was uninvited, and the rumors from the party were much larger,
something abuot Bleys trying to kidnap the Guest of Honor, by force, and
how he was turned away by a show of arms ... There was also some story
about a fire in the Back Gardens, a sorcerous duel on the rooftops, and a
damsel in distress rescued by Flora, rescued from "durance Vile".
 
Bleyse had to spend many a year repairing his reputation with all the
nobles present (and Flora really stacked the deck)  Later you were invited
by Eric to watch a duel between him and Bleys, over what he did to Flora
... though you never found out what that was, precicely ...

Right.  He isn't going to miss one of Flora's parties.  She would whine his
ear of if he did, and, besides, they usually are quite fun.

Umm ... no.  The other doesn't watch you all that closely.

It's her party.  You wouldn't be surprised if she knew who really was under
every costume.
 
-=> ...  Nice bit about the "She'll do nicely" too.
-=> Why thank you. That was my counter twist to your knife...
 
Sort of like replacing my nice, clean sharpened blade, with one of those
nasty, wavy, seraded jobbies, huh?
 
-=>  Oh,
-=> >and the servants that Bleys had, were imported, they were "just shadows".
-=> Of course.  That's why it was only a rumor no one got terribly upset over...
 
-=> >More later ... I'm not entirely coherent at the moment.
-=> Dunno, you seem relatively coherent to me...then again, look who's talking

No, really,  I had to read each paragraph more than once to get it to sink
in.  My eyeballs hurt, and they are complaining about my babbling on about
the small pink ... never mind.

I'll let you tell her that, she might take it wrong (or correctly,

-=> I was trying to make this a short one, but here's a small bit on Celeste
-=> spying on her own funeral.  Look! A segment without Brand!
 
Ahh ... but it won't be, for long.
 
-=> My father is now, and always will be, a selfish bastard.  I was never
-=> anything more to him than a show piece, some prize he'd thought he won.
-=> Never did that become more apparent to me than when Grandmother was kind
-=> enough to show me my funeral.  It was an interesting day
-=> That day's lesson was in the Tower, where Grandmother had said she intended
-=> to teach me the arts of scrying.
 
And perhaps the art of patience as well ...
 
-=> All things considered, especially knowing
-=> even the lower level of skill available, I will not endeavor to put her
-=> teachings into writing.
 
You are physically incapable of setting down casually what she taught you
of the magical arts ... that's inherent in the teachings.  Under certain
rituals, and within certain protections you may, but she never seems to
bother with books ...
 
-=> Somehow, I believe she'd approve of that decision.
-=> I was getting in practice in focusing the Tower Crystal on the desired
-=> subject, but was having a bit of trouble getting it quite right.
-=> Grandmother assisted, telling me she had just the perfect place to look at,
-=> I would enjoy it.
-=> At first I was slightly confused at the scene of the small chapel before
-=> me, but realization dawned as I continued to watch and fine-tune.  Father
-=> was there, and he was apparently getting together some sort of half-assed,
-=> rushed funeral job.  My astonishment grew as it became clear it was MY
-=> funeral.
 
He was doing it with great pomp.  He does EVERYTHING he can with dash and
style. You could tell it was your funeral, for, on the bier, was a somewhat
charred body that resembled you fairly well.  If you ask, Clarissa will
supply that it is another daughter of hers, who, apparently, got careless.
 
-=> I glanced at Grandmother quizzically but her face was the perfect
-=> diplomatic mask.  She almost looked innocent (no small feat) but for the
-=> small twinkle deep in her eyes.  I smothered a grin and continued to observe.
 
-=> Father seemed bored by the whole deal, and was handling it in a perfunctory
-=> manner.
 
In a very grand manner, he had imported into the Shrine of the Unicorn many
subtle and not so subtle symbols that would enhance his position and look.
 
Those showing up for it, from the family, were Bleys, Fiona, Benedict,
Eric, Dierdre, Gerard, Julian, Zach, and Random.
 
-=> I took note that Aunt Flora was tearful.  I wasn't sure if it was
-=> due to honest emotion, or just because she believed she should cry at
-=> funerals, but it was nice to know all the same.
 
Not yet ... but Random is a bit ... altered.  Y'see, he is still broken up
about his younger sister, and this hammers it home for him all the more.
He is in a back, shadowy corner, and remains there for the whole rest of
this.  You might also get the impression that he was here before Bleys
started ... but you don't know why.
 
-=> Fiona looked a bit
-=> impatient.  Heh.  Interestingly enough, Uncle Eric attended, and he
-=> actually looked at bit put out at Father.  I made a mental note of that,
-=> and continued to watch.  Brand was absent, and I was sure that was for a
-=> number of reasons, not the least of which being he would know better.  I
-=> would have been disappointed in him if he was buying that crap.
 
-=> There were a few prayers, a few words spoken, then Father stood up.  I
-=> suspect Fi pushed him to his feet.
 
The High Priest would have invited Bleys to the podium ... with a look of
disgust, that you could see, and the Priest could see but not others, he
got up and went forward.
 
-=> "My daughter was" here he shrugged, "stubborn and strong willed.  She loved
-=> to be contradictory.  She refused to claim her heritage, I told her it
-=> would kill her.  Guess it did."
 
He would have started kindly, about how beautiful you were, as a credit to
him, and how, even when you were engaging in your little childish games of
power, you were a credit to him.  How he did such a marvelous job in
raising you.  He would have wrapped it up with something along the lines of
it being a pitty you refused to claim your heratige, for if you had, you
might be alive today.
 
-=> The bastard sat down looking smug.  I
-=> glanced at my Grandmother again, but her face was as inscrutable as the
-=> Sphinx.  I sighed and half-heartedly watched the rest.  I felt a bit
-=> vindicated to note Eric was looking daggers at Father from the back of the
-=> chapel.  Things wrapped up fast,
 
-=> seeming unplanned and hurried, and a few
-=> went through the motions of visiting the cenotaph.  Aunt Flora lit a
-=> candle, bless her sentimental soul.  I noted that Father only walked
-=> partway there, then stopped to have some sort of conference with Fi that
-=> for some reason I couldn't pick up.  They vanished off together, not even
-=> bothering to stay until the end.  Selfish bastard.  Well, at least it was
-=> more fuel for the fire, as they say.
 
With Bleys thanking everyone for their time to show him their compassion.
Then he walked, back, towards his seat, held out his arm for Fi, and the
two walked out.  Benedict then would have come forward, placed a hand on
the corpse's head, bowed his for a moment, and then turned and left.  Eric
would have then stood up and made a much more pleasant statement, but not a
very substantitive one.  He didn't really know you well enough to do so,
but he is really good at smoothing things over, and saying the right thing
at state occasions.  Then he would turn to go, but Zach would catch his
eye, and look to his (Eric's) chair.  Eric would sit back down.  Servants
(from the Shrine) would come in and remove the acouterments that Bleys had
had installed.
 
Julian would then go up, and pay his respects, and leave.
 
Eric, Dierdre, Gerard, and Zach seem to be just sitting there.  You would
go to end the scrying, but Grandmother would say "wait".  Eric trumps in
Caine.  Dierdre trups in Corwin. (yes this is before he dissapeared).  They
take seats.  In a little bit, Florimel would come in, dressed appropriately
for the occasion.  She is drawn, as if she has been crying privately.  She
waves her hand to the servants following her, they are from her personal
staff, they go and make some subltle changes to the Shrine, and it really
looks like a hall of mourning now.
 
She goes to the front, has a word with the priest softly, where noone else
could hear (Flora: "He couldn't be found?" Priest: "No, I'm sorry." Flora:
"Me to.") And makes a speech as she could, commenting accurately on you,
and all your good points.  Doesn't smear Bleys at all, except for the fact
that she never mentions him.  It doesn't seem like a glaring omission, and
you only notice it after she is done.  Now it feals like a real funeral,
and you are probably touched by it.  All present seem to care.  (Even
Random is leaking tears, but very quietly, so as not to draw attention to
himself.)   Flora lights a candle for you, and lays a flower on your bier.
You are caught with tears over that one, for it looks very similar to the
flowers you leave at your mother's grave.
 
Flora sits.  They each come up (in age order) (except Random) and leave a
token, and leave ... slowly, as if burdened with grief.
 
As the last of them leave.  Flora rises again, and comes up to the corps.
She pats your hand and says "Don't worry, I'll take care of her."  (You
have no idea what that means at the time, but later, when you are scrying
to your mothers grave on the 12 of May, for you cannot leave to visit, you
find that Flora has left the flower offering for her that you could not.)
 
The chapel is empty, except for Random and the body.  He isn't moving.  You
go to brake it, but Grandma says again "wait".
 
After a bit, Brand comes in.  He is a wreck.  It looks like he has dragged
his body through hell and back.  He carefully looks around (but doesn't
seem to notice Random) and raises some fairly complex wards.  It looks like
they are going to shatter your view, but Grandma steps in to help hold it.
 
He goes to pieces cradling the head of the body.
 
Finally, he puts himself back together.  Kisses the body on the lips one
final time.  And leaves, taking his wards with him.  Your eyes are probably
leaking.  Again Grandma would say "wait".
 
Oberon would arrive.  He would stop and look at Random.  Random seems
oblivious to him.  He would go up to the body.  He would look down on
it.  Lay his hand on it.  Then look up and laugh.  It is somewhat of a
self-mocking laughter.  "The boy doesn't even know his own daughter." is
his exit line.  He would turn, and, after a burst of creation, toss a small
pendant with the symbol of the Darkover Comyn onto the bier, and say,
something to the effect of "Whomever you are, I am sorry you have passed
on, even though you have done it so well."  Then he'd say to Random,
"Come son."
 
And Random will reply, "But she is still gone."
 
"As you wish."  With a heavy sigh, Oberon will leave the Shrine of the
Unicorn.
 
You are wiped.  Grandman was holding it in the end almost entirely.  She
leaves you the peace you need.

-=>         "Patience Celeste.  You must learn patience.  We'll find him if it's

-=>         "Good morning" he nodded pleasantly, "may I join you?  I have found

-=>         As he drew near at Grandmother's nod his words faltered, eyes

Yes, the butterfly clip for your hair.  Only you or the gifter is alowed to
put it in place or remove it.  It says "taken" very loudly.  It is the only
way hair is bound up there ... therefore un"taken" women have their hair
down.
 
Perhaps yours is crafted so it flutters?

The only addition I might make to this piece is that there probably was an

Everything else is nailed pretty exactly.

The Funeral - rewritten and awaiting thy commentaries Oh God :-)
 
My father is now, and always will be, a selfish bastard.  I was never
anything more to him than a showpiece, some prize he'd thought he won.
Never did that become more apparent to me than when Grandmother was kind
enough to show me my funeral.  It was painful day I will never forget=85
That day's lesson was in the Tower, where Grandmother had said she intended
to teach me the arts of scrying, and in retrospect, perhaps to teach a
little patience as well.  Information comes to those who wait.  I cannot
put down here her teachings, nor would I bother going through the various
rituals that might allow me to.  You want to learn, YOU study with her.
I was getting in practice in focusing the Tower Crystal on the desired
subject, but was having a bit of trouble getting it quite right.
Grandmother assisted, telling me she had just the perfect place to look at,
I would enjoy it.

At first I was slightly confused at the scene of the small chapel before
me, but realization dawned as I continued to watch and fine-tune.  Father
was there, and he was apparently getting together something that looked a
cross between a funeral and a theatrical production, with great flash and
style.  My astonishment grew as it became clear it was MY funeral, brought
home most clearly by the somewhat charred body resting on the bier at the
front of the chapel.  It bore more than a slight resemblance to me, and I
gasped in surprise.  I glanced at Grandmother quizzically but her face was
the perfect diplomatic mask.
"But, who is it?" I blurted out in confusion.
She sighed.  "That would seem to be one of my daughters whom you have never
met dear.  I would say, apparently, she was a bit careless."
I stared speechless for a moment, then returned my attention to the
spectacle before me.
Father seemed to have directed a redecoration of the Shrine, which was
apparent from the number of vaguely symbolic objects and bric-a-brac
emphasizing his colors and personal symbols.  It wasn't exactly cheap
looking, but the whole setup had the overall effect of making him look
awfully good there.  What a bastard he is.  He even used my funeral as a
stage to preen on.
I noted with interest the family members who were in attendance.  Eric was
there, for which I was glad, as well as Benedict, Dierdre, Gerard, Julian
and Zach.  Fiona had put in an appearance which just made me uneasy.  Then
I noticed, sitting far in the back corner away from anyone else was Random.
 He looked like he'd been there for a while, seemingly very settled in and
not at all well.   I felt bad for him.
There were a few prayers, a few words spoken, then the High Priest motioned
to Father and invited him onto the podium to say a few words.    Because he
was sitting in the front, where he looked best, no one but the myself and
the Priest could see his face.  I guess that means no one else saw the look
of disgust that was on it, but I'll certainly never forget it.
I listened in growing disgust myself, as he waxed elegant for a time.  He
spoke of my memorable beauty, as a reflection of him, and of my elegant
style, as a reflection of him.  He mentioned with great humor his
appreciation of even my simple, childish games of will with him, a credit
to how he raised me properly.  He spoke of his everlasting efforts and
devotion as a father until I felt sick to my stomach.  Then he drove the
knife home.
"My daughter was" here he shrugged, "stubborn and strong willed.  She loved
to be contradictory.  She refused to claim her heritage, seeing this as yet
another front to contest willpower with me.  It is a pity, for if she'd
listened to me she might still be alive now."  The bastard sat down, wiping
a false tear from his eye.  I glanced at my Grandmother again, but her face
was as inscrutable as the Sphinx.  I sighed and half-heartedly watched the
rest.  I felt a bit vindicated to note Eric was looking daggers at Father
from the back of the chapel. =20
Things wrapped up fast, seeming unplanned and hurried, and I noted that
Father took the time to thank everyone personally for their show of support
and compassion.  When he finally was finished, he walked back toward his
seat, holding out an arm to Fiona.  She joined him and they left together.
Uncle Benedict stood once father was gone.  I saw him go forward and put a
hand gently on the corpse's head, bow his own head for a moment and then
leave.  I felt strangely moved by watching this, and vaguely like an
intruder.  Eric stood, and I leaned forward curiously.
Eric walked to the front of the Shrine, and turned to face those still
gathered.  He spoke for a few moments, quietly speaking about my love of
life and the pleasures I shared with those who cared.  He didn't say much
in detail, but his words were kind and poignant, and it felt good to know
he'd bothered.  He finished and turned to go, but I noticed Zach motion him
over with his eyes.  Eric paused, then resumed his original seat.  Caught
in conflicting emotions, I continued to watch, wondering why Aunt Flora
hadn't come, and hoping Brand didn't see this.
A few servants filed in, quietly and respectfully.  They began gently
removing all of my father's decorations and accoutrements, restoring the
simple beauty of the Unicorn's Shrine.
When they'd finished, almost as if on cue, Julian rose and approached the
bier.  He lowered his head for a moment, then turned and left quietly.  I
guess he didn't like father's theatrics either.
No one moved for a time; Eric, Dierdre, Gerard, Zach and Random all sat
silently.  I moved to break the connection, but Grandmother placed a hand
on my arm.
"Wait" was all she said, so I continued watching.
There was, after a moment, a rainbow shimmer and Caine appeared clasping
Eric's hand.  A moment later Corwin trumped to Dierdre.  Re-interested, I
continued to observe the Shrine.  Caine and Corwin sat down, all of them
seemingly waiting.
Then I understood.  Aunt Flora entered the Shrine, in a plain yet lovely
gown of mourning and I felt my eyes grow moist.  She looked pale and drawn,
and I was sure she'd been crying.  She motioned softly to the staff
attending her - her staff I noticed - and they moved about the Shrine at
her direction like ghosts, adding subtle changes.  It really looked like a
funeral now and I thought I saw Random grow a bit paler.
Aunt Flora walked slowly towards the bier and turned to the High Priest
waiting patiently there.  Her words were pitched for his ears only but the
Crystal provided a perfect and terrible front row seat.
"He couldn't be found?" she said to him.
"No" the priest replied, eyes downcast, "I'm sorry."
"So am I" she said sadly and I knew then who she meant.  I felt my cheeks
flush as my tears coursed steadily down my face.  Grandmother moved closer
behind me and I felt her support and her scrutiny.
Aunt Florimel turned to the gathered family there and spoke, her voice soft
but steady.  Her speech was simple yet so elegant and they were the words
of someone who knew me far better than I ever realized.  I knew then that
they were also the words of someone who cared for me a great deal.  It
seemed to touch everyone there, the room growing solemn and bleak.  Random
cried silently in the back corner and again I felt so very bad for him.
She finished her soliloquy.  Aunt Flora turned back to the bier.  She lit a
single tapir candle and then pulled a small spray of flowers from her
shawl.  As she placed them on the body my breath caught in my throat.  They
were identical to the flowers I put on my mother's grave every year.  That
simple gesture on her part spoke volumes to me and I choked back a sob.
After this Aunt Flora found a seat quietly.  Eric stood again.  This time
there were no words of reassurance.  He placed a small flower by the body,
which I recognized as from the restaurant in that shadow where he'd taken
me to lunch.  The lump rose again in my throat.  Eric stepped aside
carefully and silently left.
Next came Corwin, Uncle Corwin whom I hardly knew.  He looked genuinely sad
to my wonderment.  He too had a single flower to place on the body, one
silver rose.  He paused for a moment.  Taking a single step back, he waited
quietly for his sister Dierdre who was right behind him.  Dierdre stepped
up and just stood looking down for a long minute.  She reached down and
placed three silver coins unfamiliar to me in the corpse's hand.
"For the journey" she said softly then turned to go.  She left on Corwin's
arm, the two of them filing out slowly.
Uncle Caine came forward seeming almost contemplative.  He placed what
looked to me like a miniature ship compass on the bier without a word, then
turned on his heel and left with a measured pace.  I watched him go
thoughtfully.
Uncle Gerard stood slowly as if bearing a great weight on his shoulders.
He went to the side of the bier and stood gazing down for a long while, a
faint frown on his face.  I had seen what he carried in one hand already
and it made me cry harder to see him gently place the Minotaur mask on the
still form.
"Guess I was late this time" he muttered gruffly.  This brought to mind all
the times Gerard hadn't been late, all the times he'd been there to pick up
the pieces for me.  He too slowly turned and left, his eyes on the ground.
Zach finally rose, his steps seeming to drag.  He laid a single arrow on
the bier with a sober look.
"I'm sorry" he said simply before turning to go.
Still Random didn't move and I was a worried for him.  After a time, Aunt
Flora went forward again.  Gently she patted the charred hand on the corpse.=
 =20
"Don't worry dear, I'll take care of her" she said.  It wasn't until
sometime later that I learned the meaning of that cryptic remark.  Scrying
on my mother's shadow in remembrance of her, since I couldn't go there, I
was surprised to see Aunt Flora carefully laying the same spray of flowers
on her grave I had always taken there.  Flora, I can't ever begin to repay
all my debts of kindness to you.
Finally even Aunt Flora left, leaving that eerie form on the bier and the
silently weeping Random in the shadows.  I wondered if he was going to come
through this all right.  Time passed, and finally I moved to break away
from that painful scene again.  And again, Grandmother stopped me with a
simple "Wait".
Unexpectedly the door to the Shrine slammed open and my eyes went wide in
horror.  Brand staggered in, his clothes torn and bloody, cuts and bruises
lacerating his face.  He favored his left leg badly and his eyes were wild
and grief-stricken.  I heard myself moan softly.  Grandmother put a hand on
my back and subtly strengthened the connection where I'd almost let it drop.
Brand looked around the Shrine, though he didn't seem to notice Random, and
began casting a complicated series of sorcerous protections fully warding
the room.  The connection began slipping from me and I felt Grandmother
move to hold it steady against the counter-magic.
Brand limped slowly to the bier and sank weakly to his knees.  He reached
out one hand as he always did to stroke that hair so identical to my own.
I caught the soft whisper of my name, just once.  His arms encircled the
head of the corpse and he fell apart, crying hysterically.  I leaned on my
Grandmother's supportive shoulder, crying as I watched his heart breaking
and I remember just repeating "No" over and over again.  She offered me
comfort and helped me to regain some composure after letting me cry for a
minute.  Finally that torturous scene wound down as Brand seemed to have
emotionally spent himself.  Quietly he sat with the corpse for a minute,
stroking her hair.  My own breath was a ragged sob.  Ever so gently he
leaned his face close to hers whispering against her lips too softly for me
to hear and kissed her goodbye.  I buried my face against my Grandmother
for a moment, unable to shake the feeling that this was one thing I should
never have seen.  As he backed away, one hand pressed palm out to his
mouth, the tears ran freely down his cheeks.  His wards dissolved around
him as he moved back down the aisle, and then he was gone.
I turned away from the Crystal to leave, but once again Grandmother's voice
admonished me to wait in a gentle tone.  Feeling horrified at what could
possibly come next, I still would not disobey her and so I looked again at
that dreadful scene.  I was emotionally drained and spent, and I felt her
take the brunt of the connection, slowly taking all of it from me as my
spirit waned.
As I continued to watch the still silent Random the door pushed open once
last time.  Grandfather entered and I stared in surprise.  He stopped
inside the door to look down at Random, but Random did not react to him at
all.  Continuing up the aisle to the bier he stood and gazed at the corpse
as many of the others had.  I wondered if he'd seen Brand come and go, if
he'd seen the state Brand was in.
Of a sudden, he looked up and started laughing, though the laughter sounded
bitter and almost self-mocking. =20
"The boy doesn't even know his own daughter" he commented as he started to
turn away.  Pausing, he held out one hand and there was a burst of energy
there.  A small pendant with the Darkover Comyn appeared in his hand and he
tossed it lightly onto the bier.
"Well, whomever you are, I am sorry you've passed on, but at least you've
done it well."
He walked back down the aisle and stopped again at Random.
"Come son."
Random looked up at last, his face pale and tear-streaked.
"But she is still gone" he said softly.
Grandfather sighed heavily. =20
"As you wish" he said, then turned and left the Shrine, leaving Random
sitting in the shadow again.
Grandmother let the scene fade at last, and I sank to my knees to exhausted
to stand.  Almost blindly, I fumbled for my trump case finally managing to
pull out Brand's trump.  I stared at it for a time with no result.  I felt
Grandmother regarding me silently, and finally she turned as if to go.
"Please" I said softly, holding a hand up to her, "can you find him?"
She looked at the tears streaming down my face thoughtfully for a moment,
then glanced at the card briefly.
"I'm sorry dear, you just can't reach him right now.  He isn't receiving.
>From anyone."  Her voice was tinged with sorrow and she looked at me not
unkindly.  "Why don't you go down, have some tea and then rest for a bit
dear?"
Mutely I nodded and wandered away.  I felt her watch me go silently and I
was grateful for her kindness and unspoken understanding.
I found my way to a cup of tea and wandered off to be alone.  I don't
remember now where I went, but eventually I think I was heading for my
room.  I was in shock, and Grandmother was letting me alone to work it out
for myself.
I was shaken from a self-indulgent reverie in a small atrium by a voice
raised in pained anger nearby.  Startled, I realized it was Brand.
"You SAID you would PROTECT her!" I heard him rage.
"Maybe you should=85" I heard Grandmother say before her voice dropped to an
inaudible range.  I started towards the voices when Brand burst through the
archway into the atrium.  I saw, in a split-second, Grandmother pause in
the arch, then wave her hand briefly and fade away.  Her eyes met mine and
I saw the ghost of a smile.
All this in the time it took Brand to cross the walkway that pull me to him
in the most fierce hug he'd ever given me.  By the time he reached me we
were both in tears.
"Celeste, Celeste, I thought=85" his voice choked.
I cried while I was clinging to him, "I'm so sorry love, I sorry that
bastard put you through that=85"
He pulled away slightly, looking confused for a brief moment before I saw
realization register.
"You knew?"
I pointed up towards the tower, "I s-s-saw!  I c-could only wa-watch" I
sobbed.
His face registered horror and he held me closer.
"Shhh, that must have been terrible" he whispered.
I held up the trump I was still holding.  "You=85you didn't answer=85"
His eyes were pained.
"I wasn't dealing with=85aw, I'm sorry Celeste.  I thought you were gone" he
said softly.  He reached out his hand like always to stroke my hair, and in
my mind I saw him reach out again to touch that corpse on the bier.  I
collapsed in tears, unable to hold up any more.
He held me close while I cried until I must have fallen asleep in his arms.
 I don't know how long I slept, but when I woke up he was still holding me.
 I opened my eyes to see Brand smiling gently at me, though he looked
exhausted as well.  Warily I searched his eyes, but there was no hint of=
 ice.
Hesitantly, I smiled back.  "Brand, you look tired.  Are you, um, ok?"
He understood.  "Everything's fine.  But I guess I am a little tired."
Much calmer now, I looked closer and he still looked like he'd been beat
up.  I felt terrible.
"C'mon, why don't you get some rest?"  He let me lead him up to my room.
Grandmother was conspicuously absent for which I was immanently grateful.
We curled up together in my room and both slept for what must have been a
long while.
We were woken later by a soft knock on the door.  A servant came in with a
generous meal, and a note from Grandmother.
Celeste dear
I think that was a rather strenuous lesson.  I won't be expecting you for
at least two days.  I expect you'll use your time wisely of course.
Oh yes.  Oberon will most likely be keeping an eye out for you now dear,
but he can't look here.  I suggest you restrict your time off to staying
here exclusively, especially while you have a guest visiting.  He's so
backwards about some things.
And Brand dear, do get some rest.  You're not looking your best.
Enjoy your breakfast children.
Love Clarissa.
We spent all of the next two days together, and only once saw Grandmother
in passing.  She nodded pleasantly going about her own business and let us
be, though she did pause to comment to Brand that he was looking so much
better.
After that visit Brand returned to Darkover occasionally, though
infrequently, to visit and Grandmother always found some excuse to give me
'a little time off'.  I only wish now I could have kept him there with me.

Hmm ... Interesting twist on the invitation ... I like it.  You left enough
vague, and, Darkstare is somewhat more ofhanded towards most people, but
his touch of formality might have been brought up by whom the invitiation
was sent by.  He doesn't seem in awe of your Grandmother, and treats her
more as a respected collegue, as opposed to a superior power ... but you
are pretty sure (since you worship her so) that it is an indulgence that
she allows him.

Segment of Clarissa's offer conveyed via Darkstar to Celeste.  See?  You
give me a sentence, I give you a short story.  Just think of all the trees
we could kill...:
                                                                                     
I was far our in shadow when my teacher, Darkstar, caught up with me.  No
great feat for him, he had a habit of showing up without warning, but he
never set off alarm bells when he did so.  He approached with what was, for
him, an easy grin.
"Celeste" he said easily, "I have an interesting offer for you=85one I
believe you'll find, shall we say, irresistible?"
"Greetings Darkstar" I replied, "what's up?  What's this all about?"
He incongruously perched himself on top of a nearby rock, a mischievous
expression across his features.  "First, let's see your latest work."
I sighed, and pulled out my trumps, selecting my latest creation.  I handed
him a trump of my home shadow of Erelorne.  Recreated from the faded
memories of childhood, I didn't suppose I'd gotten it quite right.  This
was confirmed by his silent scrutiny.
"You haven't been there for some time?" he asked.
"No, I haven't seen it like that since I was a child.  But I couldn't bring
myself to draw it as it is."  I felt sad, thinking of it.
He nodded slowly.  "You've embellished, quite a bit.  But
technically=85technically it's not too bad.  You're getting better."
I looked up, surprised at the unexpected compliment.  He regarded me
thoughtfully.
"Would you mind a few=85breaks=85in our lessons Celeste?" he asked=
 carefully.
I considered.  "If you think that's best."  I'd never known him to suggest
things too frivolously, so I assumed he had a good reason.  Probably
testing me.
Darkstar nodded again.  "Your Grandmother has, shall we say, empowered me
to make you an offer.  She's willing to take you on as a=85project."
I was very surprised. =20
"When?" I stammered, not knowing what else to say.
He shook his head, his carapace making a sinuous sound.
"There is more to it than that, child" he warned, his voice taking on that
instructor's edge, "This is no ordinary opportunity and it comes at no
small cost."  He looked away, almost diplomatically.
"I'm sure your have, friends, you could ask."  His faceted eyes focused on
my again, seriously.
"This offer is made but once, and when you accept you will stay with her
until your 'studies' are complete, by her standards.  Do you understand me?
 It is a serious commitment."
I sat in contemplative silence, considering his words.  A question, well
many questions, came to mind.
"Do you mean once I go, I can't leave?  Will you be there to continue our
lessons as well?"
He nodded slightly.  "You comprehend correctly.  But my visits will likely
be sporadic; when I can, when there's time, when it's allowed, you follow?"
I pursed my lips thoughtfully.
"When is my answer expected?"
His eyes fixed mine strongly and deliberately.  "Once the invitation is
given."
        Slowly I nodded my understanding of his message, and his face shifted
in
what I understood passed for a smile.
"Can you postpone making the invitation for, say, a day or two?"
"I will find you tomorrow and you will have your answer ready" he agreed.
I started to thank him, but he waved me off impatiently.
"No longer than that Celeste, I'm quite serious.  Tomorrow, whether or not
you're ready."  With that, he was gone.
I spent maybe half an hour of my now precious time gathering my thoughts
before I trumped Brand.  I suspected Darkstar had been referring to him,
which meant we weren't always as circumspect as I'd hoped.  Then again, if
he was collaborating with my Grandmother, I imagined his information
sources were far superior to the people I truly worried about.
The trump grew cold instantly, a phenomenon I'd noticed more and more as of
late, and then grew alarmingly colder still.  My fingers felt numb as an
almost arctic chill radiated from the card.  Brand came into focus with
snow swirling over his boot tops.  Vicious winds howled over icy peaks
behind him.  He looked tired, annoyed and very cold.  I wondered again how
he did that with trump calls.
"Celeste" he sighed through blue-tinged lips, "let me guess.  It can't
wait, can it."  His eyes clouded over slightly, losing focus.
Ruefully, I ducked my head to hide a small smile.  "No, I'm sorry Brand,
this time I don't think it really can."
His fingers curled to fists as he looked away slightly.  He closed his
eyes, lips moving silently.  He shook his head as if shedding the memory of
a bad dream, then raised his gaze to me again, eyes slightly more in focus
as he spoke through clenched teeth.
"Give me an hour or two, I'll be" he stared past me for a moment, "there.
Alright?"  The last word was clipped short as the contact severed abruptly.
 I sighed, rubbing feeling back into my hands and settled in to wait.
Finding a small tree, I leaned back to close my eyes and rest.
"Celeste?  Celeste!"  Someone was shaking me awake, not ungently.
"Mmm?" I woke up slowly, feeling exhausted.  It was almost dark, and a
blazing fire burned nearby in a small but cheerful camp.  I wasn't quite
sure just how I'd slept through all that getting set up.  Brand was
crouched down next to me, looking amused.
"Are you alright?  You talk in your sleep you know."
"Mmph" I agreed sleepily, accepting the cup I noticed him holding out.
"This place give you strange dreams, but I'm fine."  He regarded me closely
for a moment, still looking vaguely amused, then nodded.
"And what was so urgent that couldn't wait?" he asked with a small smile.
I stretched and moved over towards the fire, settling comfortably with my
cup of tea on the cloak spread out there.  My gaze moved to the starry deep
purple sky.
"I received an=85invitation.  From Clarissa."  I glanced over at him as he
joined me near the fire, one eyebrow arching.  I went on, choosing words
carefully.
"She's invited me to study with her but the conditions seem fairly
stringent.  They were detailed to me and I only have until sometime
tomorrow to=85"
"Take it" he cut me off.  "I know the conditions, " I noted he winced
slightly, "but you shouldn't pass it up.  I wish I hadn't" he muttered=
 softly.
I sat up with interest.  "You were invited and turned her down?  Why Brand?"
        He sighed and looked away.  "It's not that simple and that's not
really
important now.  What matters is that it's not a chance you should miss."
One hand reached out, absently playing with a strand of my hair.  "I'd like
to know you had a chance.  Please, take her offer."
I watched him quietly, quite sure there was more to the story than that and
equally sure I wouldn't hear it.  But I was certain he wouldn't advise me
to anything that would hurt me.
"I get the impression" I said softly, "that I won't see you for a long time
when I go."
"Likely not" he agreed, a shadow dancing across his eyes that I couldn't
quite catch.  I moved closer to him, whispering, "That's the hardest part."
He pulled my close into a tight hug, and I almost thought I heard him
mutter under his breath, "I hope that's so."
I turned to question him and ask what that meant, but he drew me in and
drove all thought and questions away for the night.
 
The morning sun had already climbed high overhead when I awoke.  The fire
was half-smothered embers and Brand was gone.  He'd left his cloak draped
over me as a blanket and there was a small package left on the ground near
my hand.
Sleepily I started to sit up, then realized keeping the cloak around me
might be prudent seeing that was all I was wearing.
"Ahem" came a dry, amused voice from behind me, "perhaps you'd care for
some breakfast?  After you find your clothes?  I imagine you're fairly
hungry=85"
I whirled around to see Darkstar sitting some 15 yards away.  I smiled
sheepishly.
"I see you put your decision time to good use" he quipped.
"Sure" I grinned at him, "but you can join me over here."
"Alas" he gestured dramatically, "dear child, I cannot in fact 'join you
over there'.  I assumed correctly then that is not of your devising?"
I looked at him in a fairly confused manner I must imagine and he sighed, a
ghostly rattling noise.
"Your=85campsite=85has one hell of a protective barrier around it.  I figure=
d
it was far easier and less time consuming to just wait for you to wake up.
Besides, I wasn't quite sure what it would trigger if I played with it, and
I just don't like those energies."
I stared around in astonishment.  Now that I was paying attention the lines
of power were obviously there.  I couldn't make any sense out of it
however; it was way beyond my skill.
Darkstar sat patiently while I goggled for a moment then cleared his throat
again.
"Breakfast Celeste?  Remember?"
I grinned again, gathering my things in a rush and tripping over the cape
two or three times.  Darkstar rolled his eyes.
"Your rather misplaced modesty is slowing you down considerably" he pointed
out helpfully while rummaging in a basket.  I ignored the jibe and kept the
cape.
Crossing the barrier I winced in anticipation, but all I felt was a
pleasant tingle.
"Very nice work, that", Darkstar noted.
I looked back and saw the barrier shimmer and fade as I left the area.  In
just a heartbeat it was gone.
"Thank you for the thought love" I whispered to the deserted campsite, then
turned away to see Darkstar busily rummaging through the basket again.  He
looked for all the world far to busy to have heard me and it seemed just a
bit too intentional.  I did like him.
"Thank you for bringing breakfast, I was hungry," I said pleasantly as I
sat down near him.  He gave me one of those 'just eat' looks.  We ate.
"Well" he said with a flourish, "I have this invitation to deliver to you."
 We were just finishing the meal, which had thoughtfully included a strong
coffee variant.
"Really?" I blinked at him, wide-eyed.  "For a party of some sort perhaps?"
"Impetuous brat" he muttered.  "Yes or no Celeste."
"Yes, of course, I'd have to be just nuts to turn down such 'a unique
learning opportunity'.  Weren't those your words, oh great teacher?"
He sighed at me.   "Sometimes I wonder if you might be more trouble than
you're actually worth.  Let's go, your Grandmother is expecting you today."
"Is she?  She knew I'd accept?" I asked.
"Let's say she was fairly confident" he replied, offering me a hand up.
"And get dressed first, will you?  I am not going to be responsible for
delivering you to your Grandmother in your birthday suit."
I grinned and pulled my clothes back on under the cape.  I picked up the
small package and tucked it into my trump case for later.  Keeping the
cape, and abandoning the breakfast basket I took Darkstar's arm as he
trumped us away.
And so I went to Darkover.

Ok God, here you go...the rewrite of doom.
 
My eighteenth birthday was a wild success, beyond anything I could have
hoped for.  It's Aunt Flora I have to thank, for she turned out to have a
undercurrent of devious almost as strong as mine.  It made me regret ever
being unkindly towards her, and perhaps that was her goal all along.  But
deep down I understood that Flora never wanted anything other than the best
for me.  I'm quite sure she enjoyed the dig at father though, seeing as he
was trying to exclude her from the plans entirely.
Aunt Flora approached me months ahead of time, quite enthusiastic over the
idea of planning a gala event for my coming-of-age birthday.  I never did
have the heart to turn her down, and besides, it sounded fun.
She began organizing her plans to combine the party with a formal ball.  I
begged her to make it a masquerade ball, and she was delighted with the
thought too.  I'd long been fascinated with the concept, and wheels were
already turning in my head.  Aunt Flora said I just _couldn't_ see the
decorating theme ahead of time, but I could choose one favorite thing for
the banquet table.  I've always loved exotic desserts, so I naturally
requested my version of cherise jubilee, with cherries, strawberries, kiwi
and chocolate crepes.  If you've never tried it, I tell you, you've never
lived.
The parts of the planning I _was_ allowed in on we mostly did up in Aunt
Flora's rooms (where her scheduling books were readily available).  And I
can't help but wonder, in retrospect, if dear Aunt Flora didn't do that
quite intentionally as well.
The party was still over a month away, when Father approached me after
dinner one evening.  He took my arm as I was leaving the Hall, asking me to
come speak with him in the study.  Surrupticiously noting the number of
curious glances behind us, I shook my arm free distastefully. =20
"I suppose" I sighed loudly, sounding as put out as possible.  Several of
the glances turned to smiles and I had to cover my own.  Father, a genial
grin pasted on his face, acted as if he hadn't noticed.  I suspected him up
to something.
We reached the study in a moment and I sprawled across an overstuffed
chair, affecting a bored expression.  Father blithely poured a drink,
ignoring my attitude and gazing at me with a patient smile.  Curiousity
piqued, I sat up slightly.
"Celeste dear" he began slowly, "I an aware that we don't always see eye to
eye on things, but I'm sure you'll agree how important your eighteenth
birthday is.  Naturally" he went on, "I am planning a proper celebration.
It's only right that I handle these preparations myself, no need to get
Flora involved.  I think a formal garden dinner would be appropriate and of
course I've chosen the perfect musical accompaniment for the evening.  And,
after dinner, we'll take care of that other bothersome, overdue business.
Naturally, it will be family only, though there's no need to have all of
them there."
His voice dropped to a mutter, talking to himself I suppose as if I weren't
even there, but I caught the words anyway.=20
"Julian, certainly, and likely Fiona I suppose, though I'm sure we can keep
Brand out of this."
His voice rose again with great enthusiasm and he never noticed the gleam
of pure hate that crept into my eyes at those words.  Blithely unaware, he
went on.
"Your finally taking the Pattern will be the perfect culmination to the
day, as I'm sure you're quite ready for it by now.  Afterward, I've already
decided on the perfect setting for your portrait.  And, seeing as I
arranged it so you'd have my coloring, you'll be fitted for a light blue
gown with a powder gold trim.  You'll do nicely in that."
Echoes of my childhood boiled to the surface as I again heard him through
the ears of a terrified five year old, speaking to my mother.
"Prettier than you.  She'll do nicely."
I covered my mouth to stifle the scream I felt building in my head.
Inside, I howled in fury and pain, the suppressed scream echoing in my
mind.  I felt my eyes go wide in horror as he turned to grin at me,
obviously proud of himself.  The grin faded slightly at my expression.
"What?" he asked, slightly annoyed.  "What's wrong with you?  Damn, did I
forget something?" He was oblivious to what he'd just said, oblivious to
the pain he'd triggered.  I swallowed hard, forcing the bile back down my
throat.  In the momentary silence, I heard quick and quiet footfalls in the
hallway.  Father didn't seem to notice them.
"No, no father" I said a bit too quickly, thinking fast.  "It's just
that=85well=85I, um, already sort of had a gown picked out, and I really wan=
ted
to wear it, and=85"
"Say no more" he raised a hand, the self-assured grin back to normal, "for
such an occasion we can afford to indulge our little princess a bit, eh?
Well, so long as it doesn't conflict with my own colors, of course."  And
here he peered at me appraisingly, seeming to expect an answer.
Mutely I shook my head in disbelief, which he seemed content to take as
confirmation that the colors were fine.
"Good, good" he enthused, "the rest I believe I'll keep a secret for now.
Wouldn't want you to have no surprises on your birthday."  Nauseatingly, he
winked at me.  "That will be all.  I'll send a servant to fetch you when
things are ready.  You may go now Celeste."  He favored me with a smile,
then turned to fix himself another drink.  I could almost see him patting
himself on the back.
I bolted from the room.  As I rounded the corner heading for the stairs, I
nearly ran Brand over.  His reflexes were superb as he neatly caught me,
and I realized later he had been waiting for me.  My mind babbled crazily
at me to escape from whatever was grasping me, but panic subsided as I
heard his voice close to my ear.
"Shh, shh, whoa slow down there."  He glanced around once, carefully, then
quickly steered me into a small sitting room that was infrequently used.
Guiding me into a chair, he crouched down, keeping his hands on mine.
"Did he hurt you?  I heard you screaming, but I couldn't=85" One hand reache=
d
up to smooth back my hair.  "What did he do to you?"
I shook my head slowly.  "But=85but I didn't" I started, then stopped,
staring at him wonderingly.  "Not out loud" I finished.
He nodded, thoughtfully.  Shadows passed through his eyes and were gone.
"Tell me what happened."
I related the whole conversation to him, including the memory it had
dredged up, and his eyes flashed angrily.
"He'll get what he deserves.  You'll be even with him someday" he said, and
I believed him though the tone in his voice made me uneasy.  He glanced
around again, muttering something to himself that I couldn't hear. =20
"Later" he said out loud, though I wasn't sure what he meant.  He looked
back at me. =20
"Go on up and see Flora.  You've got a lot to do=85and this isn't wise" he
said much more kindly, giving me a quick hug.
Feeling much better, I went to Aunt Flora's rooms.  Somehow, I just forgot
to mention the conversation to Aunt Flora.  Guess it simply slipped my
mind.  Aunt Flora wouldn't let me in on the rest of her plans, and it
turned out she was damn good at hiding detail.  I waited impatiently for
everything to play out.
Only a week before my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised to hear Father
and Aunt Flora arguing near the study.  Creeping closer, I evesdropped for
a moment.
"You will not commandeer my staff!" Aunt Flora was saying hotly.  "They
have their own duties, and I will not have one of my affairs ruined."
"Sister, be that as it may, I have certain requirements to be met.  I have
every intent of making my own plans perfect, and the resources available
here..."
Aunt Flora cut him off in a huff.  "Get you own staff Bleys.  And stay out
of the ballroom!  I have it scheduled for that day."
Father dropped the reasonable voice, "What the hell are you planning that's
so important I can't have a few people to lend me a hand?"
Aunt Flora actually sounded smug, "It hasn't been announced yet, and I
won't spoil it just for you.  The answer is no.  My staff is busy, and my
affairs take precedence."
Father stormed out of the study, not even noticing me in the shadows.
Smiling, I ran off to Brand's room to tell him about the fight.  We were
busy coordinating our masquerade costumes that day anyway, as we had a few
plans of our own.
The day before arrived, and Father was off in shadow somewhere, doing gods
know what.  Aunt Flora made the announcement for her Masquerade Ball, and
invitations were all delivered precisely according to her schedule.  She
confided in me that absolutely _everyone_ had promised to come, and I had
to hide a snicker.  Excitedly, I scampered back upstairs to put the
finished touches on our outfits.
As the evening of the big party arrived, I had the unique pleasure of
having two servants arrive within 10 minutes of each other.  The first told
me that my father was expecting me in the back gardens.  The second said
Aunt Flora sent word it was time to make an appearance at the Ball.  I
donned my mask (which was a likeness of Athena's owl) and went to the
ballroom immediately.  Just for fun, I stole around to a window overlooking
the gardens.  Father had had the garden decorated beautifully, and there
seemed to be the makings of a fabulous party.  The only people I saw there,
however, were servants.  Smiling, I went downstairs.
The Ballroom was stunning, even Aunt Flora had outdone herself this time.
Mythological creatures from dozens of shadows cavorted and played up and
down the walls in lifelike renderings.  It seemed as if there were 200
people in the hall, and I was amazed at Aunt Flora's thoroughness.  There
were ice and fire sculptures of fabulous creatures, and in the center of
the room a beautiful ice fountain of a Unicorn, bathed in soft blue
lighting.  It was breathtaking.
I slipped into the room quietly, and found Aunt Flora after half an hour of
searching.  She had a truly spectacular mask of a figure I wasn't sure I
was familiar with. =20
"Thank you" I whispered to her, "it's so beautiful.  Thank you so much."
The mask turned to regard me for a moment, then her voice floated out.
"Of course dear, I am so glad that you're pleased.  Now go have fun."
I turned to go, and I thought I heard her say, though I couldn't be sure,=20
"Isn't it fun how you can't tell who's who."
I turned to look back at her, but she had melted into the crowd, on the arm
of a large man with the mask of a minotaur.  Thoughtfully, I wandered away.
I was enjoying a dance with Brand, later identified only as a young lord
wearing a mask of the faces of Cerberus.  At first, I hadn't even been sure
it was him, except for that mask.  He felt=85different, though I couldn't pu=
t
my finger on it.  It wasn't that icy distant feel, but it didn't seem like
Brand either.  He seemed himself, though, so I let it go.
 During that dance, a commotion broke out near the door, disrupting most of
the guests and stopping the music.  In the sudden silence, Father's voice
carried much farther then I'm sure he intended.
"...I don't care, just tell me where the hell she is!"  Heads turned, and I
had the distinct pleasure of seeing Father's face vaguely flush.  Brand's
hand tightened protectively on my arm as Father's gaze swept the room,
pulling me farther from the confrontation.  A few murmurs sounded around us.
Flora fairly flew across the room, berating him loudly before she'd even
reached the door.  It was an impressive display of temper worthy of family.
"How DARE you enter my costume ball without a costume!" she fairly screamed
at him.  "First you had the GALL to throw a party on the same day I was,
then DEMAND that my staff assist you. I gave you the COURTISY of not
inviting you, so you wouldn't feel obliged to abandon your own pitiful
efforts, in deference to a  party of my design, and you decide to try to
CRASH my party, WITHOUT a proper costume!"  The man in the minotaur mask
drifted towards their confrontation, standing so he subtly backed up
Flora's position.  Father's eyes raked the room, pinning me where I was
backing toward the banquet table, unaware that I was the only thing moving
in the room.  He looked like he was about to do something, and then backed
down suddenly, whirled, and quipped, "You haven't heard the last of this!"
With that, he left.
Later I heard a rumor through the party mention that the one word the man
in the minotaur mask said was "chamberpots".  No one understood it, though
there was much speculation on what that codeword meant.
Flora, being a hostess of near legend, had the party running smoothly again
in no time.  I danced with a number of people, including my gallant
'rescuers' in the Cerebus and Minotaur masks.  I also enjoyed a dance with
Eric, though I wasn't sure it was him till the end of the dance.  With a
twinkle behind the mask, he bowed over my hand and murmured,
"Little Bleys will someday bite off more than he can chew, and I'll be
there to hand his teeth back to him."
I giggled faintly in surprise and delight, until it occurred to me that
perhaps Eric felt towards Flora as I did about Brand.  Ever after have I
viewed him as a kindred spirit.=20
At the appropriate time, I was presented to the entire gathering, blushing
lightly, and Eric was my escort to the front of the room.  Grandfather put
in a momentary appearance to issue a kind if gruff blessing, and the room
issued a toast in my name.
The rest of the party was a smashing success, and the rumors and stories it
generated grew in the telling through years of social gatherings.   Some of
the better ones I later heard included how Bleys tried to brutally and
forcefully kidnap the guest of honor, and was driven out by a show of arms.
 I confess to pushing that one along a little myself.  I heard of a
terrible fire in the back Gardens that same day, resulting in the serious
injury of a dozen servants.  There were stories of a blazing sorcerous duel
across the roof of the castle.  Flora was a heroine in some tales that told
how she rescued a damsel in distress from the evil villian.  In another
version, it was a mysterious man in a bull's mask.  Most amusing were the
tales of myself, faint and resting from my close escape with disaster at
the unicorn statue, being fed flaming cherries by a young shadow lord in a
Cerebus mask.  I can't say it's not wholly fiction, but, you know how
rumors can get.
Father was furious, and wouldn't speak to either Flora or myself for a
week.  It was years before his reputation began to recover, to my
everlasting delight.
 
Sometime much later, I was rewarded in being invited by Eric to witness a
duel between him and Bleys.  I understood this was over Flora's honor in
some fashion, and that Father had done something to her, though no one
would tell me what it was.
It gave me great pleasure to watch Eric beat the snot out of him=85and it wa=
s
even more satisfying in that he knew I'd watched the whole thing.  He never
tried to so blatantly make plans for me again, I'm glad to say.

Well ... she might have felt pitty for him, and didn't want him to do the

do were, she would have told him.

The Darkover one's you could ask Tia about, she knows the books better than
I do.  You haven't been to an Amber one.

Beyond that ... well, Clarissa is always big on doing things up as well,
but She, unlike certain fathers I could mention, ask first and cater to the
participant's whims ...

If you want to point people to it (from the Amber crowd in general) feel
free, I don't mind other GMs using my creative twists ...

-=> "Good morning" he nodded pleasantly, "may I join you?  I have found the

-=> as they fell on me.  A dozen different emotions flickered across his face,

-=> over, sweeping me out of the chair.
-=> "Celeste!  You didn't tell me!  When?" he exclaimed, finally releasing me
-=> from the embrace. I smiled, delighted to have seen him so speechless.
-=> "It's been a little over five months.  Grandmother says she's a girl."
-=> His eyes narrowed to slightly wary.
-=> "No one knows, do they?" he asked anxiously.
-=> A throat cleared from behind us.
-=> "No dear, of course not.  And you must be very careful to keep it that way,
-=> if you want that child to survive.  Here, naturally, she's safe."
-=> Grandmother stood, holding her tea cup.  "You can't give your father any

-=> His face paled slightly, but he nodded looking back to me.
-=> "She's right.  Darkover is the safest place for the two of you."  He sat

-=> The baby squirmed and I pulled his hand to my stomach. He sat unmoving, his

-=> "Are you happy?" I asked quietly.
-=> "Whenever you are" he murmured.
-=> We sat in the garden talking until we were summoned for supper.
-=>
-=> Although he came and went briefly (often returning with gifts for the baby)
-=> Brand stayed in Darkover for the next 4 months.  Grandmother was quite
-=> tolerant as long as my lessons and her schedule were not overly
-=> interrupted.  She taught me a great deal about contolling one's own body
-=> during that time.
-=>
-=> It was during this period that it finally occurred to me what was so
-=> different about him. The shifting, dangerous moods were completely absent

-=> He looked at me sharply and I caught the echoes of pain in his eyes.
-=> "We all make our choices, but I can't talk about it Celeste.  I'm sorry.
-=> If it makes you feel better, I am happy here with you."
-=> I paused, trying a different approach, "Then maybe we could just, well,
-=> stay..."
-=> I was distracted as he snapped his fingers, standing suddenly.
-=> "Hey, don't we have some work to do in that room you're turning into a
-=> nursery?  We're running out of time.  You wanted it finished this week,
-=> right?"
-=> "Uh, yeah I did.  Did you have some more ideas?" I asked him, slightly
-=> confused.
-=> He nodded, giving me a quick kiss and offering me a hand up.  He told me
-=> about several interesting things he'd found in shadow, that he thought were
-=> just perfect for the baby, taking me off to show me what he'd brought back
-=> as examples.  I was rather caught off guard by the sudden change in topics
-=> and we were busy with the room for hours.  I realized later how easily he'd
-=> diverted my attention, but I let it go like so many other things.  It was
-=> not discussed again.
 
Good!  Though slightly in conflict with your final fairwell scene.  You
might want to add to it the sadness of seeing the Ice at all, after all the
time in Darkover.
 
-=> Forever
-=>
-=> Hours after my first arrival in Darkover, my head was still swimming from
-=> Grandmother's flurry of words, instructions and introductions.  I was
-=> sitting in my room, gazing out the window onto a spectacular view.  I had
-=> precious little to put away, though that hardly seemed to matter as my room
-=> was apparently prepared for me.  There were books, clothes, and a few items
-=> that were alarmingly to my taste if different then the styles I was used to.
-=> Pulling Brand's cloak from my shoulders to put it away, I remembered the
-=> small package tucked into my case again.  With a grin, I sat down on the
-=> bed and began unwrapping it immediately.
-=> Inside, I found a square of parchment paper carefully wound around a small
-=> cloth envelope.  Unfolding the paper, I noted Brand's script,
-=> "And so I can but ask.  Your choice.  What cannot be in one way..."
-=> Mystified, I opened the little envelope to find a silver ring tumble out
-=> onto my hand.  It was lightly engraved with a motiff of vines and leaves in
-=> delicate fairy lines.  The  leaves had a sheen like inset emeralds, but
-=> were flush with the face of the ring.  The craftsmanship was supurb.
-=> Staring delightedly, I noticed light catch something on the inside curve as
-=> I turned it.  Glancing inside, I found the inscription.
-=>
-=> Neither Owner nor Owned, Neither Keeper Nor Kept,
-=> Yet Bound as one my Soul with thine, In love Eternal you are Mine.
-=>
-=> My choice, he'd written, as if he could ever think otherwise!  I pulled out
-=> his trump instinctively, then stopped.  Darkstar had said something about
-=> not being able to trump him from here.  I tried it anyway, but there was no
-=> response.  Sighing, I supposed I'd have to wait for an opportunity to ask
-=> Grandmother how to go about such things.
                                                                                     
The card wasn't even cold.
 
Is the ring a replica of the bracelet that your mother handed you on that
day, o so long ago?
 
-=> While I thought about good excuses for why I wanted to make a trump contact
-=> to my uncle, I found a silver chain I had had for a long time.  Threading
-=> it through the ring, I hung it around my neck, under my tunic.  Yes, I
-=> would accept.
-=> Time passed, and my lessons began in earnest.  I found myself glad I had
-=> accepted the offer and I strove to please Grandmother as I could.  I held
-=> her in awe; she seemed to know just about everything.  Finally, I got up
-=> the courage to ask her about a way to call Brand.
-=>
-=> **What would Clarissa say, and does she make it clear she already knew
-=> about the relationship?
 
Weeelll ... she would be somewhat dismissive of him (he didn't accept her
offer) until she realized that you were torn by her words, and then would
say that she didn't know him well at all.  She would encourage you to talk
about him, her views would be formed from your perceptions.

-=> She would have commented on that, definately, so I want to be sure that's

No, I had in mind a different segment, which apparenntly was only written
in my mind.  You would run into him, you being disguised, and so was he,
while on assignment on Manhome (Taking out a subversive cult for the powers
on Secundus) You knew him by your heart, but he did not know you, and was
consumed by the Ice while he was there, torturing some individual for
information on the wearabouts of another.  Then he wasn't wearing it.

I think I would like to make a slight rewrite in one of Random's last lines
at the Patternfall scene.  Let me know if you think this makes sense
here...depending on HOW aware Random was during the funeral scene...
(inserted changes are between ** ** marks)
+  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +
"You forgive me?" he said.  "You, who left me in that tower, who put the
knife into my side?  Thank you, sister.  It is very kind of you to offer to
forgive me, but excuse me if I decline."  Knife?  The bitch knifed him?
"All right" Random tried, "what do you want?  An apology?  Riches and
treasure?  An important appointment?  All of these?  They are yours.  But
this is a stupid game you are playing.  **And none of this will bring her
back.**  Let us end it and go home, pretend it was all a bad dream."
I sighed.  Random had no clue.  Those **offers** might amuse, but what I
suspected Brand might want Random and Fiona couldn't grant.  **Brand's
short bark of vicious laughter drew my attention back sharply.**
"Yes, let us end it" I heard Brand saying.  "You do that by throwing down
your weapons first.  Then Fiona releases me from her spell, you all bend
knee and swear fealty.  Do it or I kill Dierdre."

What'cha think?

Mmm, make that back to two kids total then, Faythe and one boy.  Clarissa
wouldn't allow a son of Celeste and Brand to die cause of the distraction,
but she'd allow another kid to die?  Sna?  You're losing me on the logic
there...

Don't see how much worse you can get then what Leonie did to Callista, but ok.
I'm adopting lingo and speech patterns from the book in my Darkover
segments, stop me now if you don't want them used.
 
And yes, I have blatently read the book, and want to read more.  I still
don't like MZB's in-your-face writing style much, but the subject matter and
plot are well done.  And the world is interesting.  I just can't stand an
author who drives a point home by reiterating it over and over and over and
over...
 
Anyway, your charming wife has invited us over for dinner, and when my other
half returns from the store, I will be asking him if we will be accepting. :-)
(Depends really on how difficult the small child will be for him to manage)

First is the rewrite of Dangerous Ground.  It needed some additions and
polishing (especially adding the stuff about the gifts).
Second is the 'engagement' segment.  Wedding segment to follow.  It was
getting long and unwieldy, so I broke it up into two seperate stories. This
will mean redoing the index, however...

from the embrace. I smiled, delighted to have seen him so speechless.

Grandmother stood, holding her tea cup.  "You can't give your father any

His face paled slightly, but he nodded looking back to me.
"She's right.  Darkover is the safest place for the two of you."  He sat
down, holding both my hands in his.  Grandmother walked out through the
archway, smiling.
The baby squirmed and I pulled his hand to my stomach. He sat unmoving, his
eyes fairly glowed.
"Are you happy?" I asked quietly.
"Whenever you are" he murmured.
We sat in the garden talking until we were summoned for supper.
After supper, Brand went and retrieved the almost forgotten packages.  His
mannerism was almost shy though his eyes were shining.
He went first to Clarissa, he was learning custom quickly!, offering her one
of the wrapped packages.
"A small gift for your collection...Mother" he murmured, bending quickly to
kiss her lightly on the cheek.
She favored him with a warm smile, opening the package as he sat near me.
The wrappings fluttered away under her hands to reveal a lovely box covered
in inlaid gold panels.  She turned it over, caressing it lightly with her
hands and it responded with a faint click, four of the panels sliding into
new configurations.  Her eyebrows arched as she looked back to Brand.
"A true puzzle-box.  Very unusual, thank you.  It is a most interesting and
worthy gift.  I will...investigate this later."
Brand looked pleased with himself and with the compliment.  He turned to me,
handing me the other package.
"For you love."  He glanced up at Clarissa, who nodded approval.  Mystified,
I opened it eagerly.  Inside, I was delighted to find a hair clip.  Crafted
in gleaming copper, it was in the form of a hunting hawk, Brand's septicle
clasped in one upheld claw and it's wings outspread as if about to take
flight.  Emeralds were set as its eyes, and a scattering of dark star
sapphire chips made it look as though a hundred stars were reflecting from
it's feathers.  It was delicate and beautiful and I gasped in delight.
Brand glanced at Clarissa, who again nodded permission.  He took it gently
and carefully clasped it behind my head, replacing the hair clip fastened
there.  There was a faint tingling sensation that made me glance at him
curiously, a faint flush of pleasure on my cheeks.  He smiled, pleased at my
reaction.
"I wanted to give you an appropriate gift" he said softly, "do you like it?"
"It is perfect" I assured him.
Grandmother stood up.  "I have some things to do, children, I assume you can
entertain yourselves?"  With a dismissive smile, she left holding the box
carefully, a thoughtful look on her face.  We sat by the fireside for a
time, then retired for an early evening.
Although he came and went briefly (often returning with gifts for the baby)
Brand stayed in Darkover for the next 4 months.  Grandmother was quite
tolerant as long as my lessons and her schedule were not overly interrupted.
She seemed to think as long as he minded his place, he belonged with us.
Her opinions of him had been colored over time by mine, and she was far more
accepting of him than she had been in the past.  She came to treat him as
family, and though he never said so I could feel that this made him happy
but saddened him at the same time.
Grandmother taught me a great deal about contolling one's own body and
energies during that time, seemingly trying to make up for what she
considered an oversight.  I became far more sensitive to flows of energy in
the body, and was thrilled to become closer to my daughter before she was
born.  I became much more sensitive to Brand's moods and feelings as well,
though he seemed so much more self-assured in Darkover.
 
It was sometime during this period that it finally occurred to me what was
so different about him. The shifting, dangerous moods were completely absent
and I finally dredged up the corage to question him about it.
"Brand?" I started hesitantly, soon after rising one morning.  "You
seem...so much happier here.  It's almost like...well...like you're a
different person now.  Not in a bad way" I added quickly, "just...different."
He<lost>
ht the echoes of pain in his eyes.
"We all make our choices, but I can't talk about it Celeste.  I'm sorry.  If
it makes you feel better, I am happy here with you."
I paused, trying a different approach, "Then maybe we could just, well,
stay..."
I was distracted as he snapped his fingers, standing suddenly.
"Hey, don't we have some work to do in that room you're turning into a
nursery?  We're running out of time.  You wanted it finished this week,
right?"
"Uh, yeah I did.  Did you have some more ideas?" I asked him, slightly
confused.
He nodded, giving me a quick kiss and offering me a hand up.  He told me
about several interesting things he'd found in shadow, that he thought were
just perfect for the baby, taking me off to show me what he'd brought back
as examples.  I was rather caught off guard by the sudden change in topics
and we were busy with the room for hours.  I realized later how easily he'd
diverted my attention, but I let it go like so many other things.  It was
not discussed again.
 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
Forever
 
Only hours, though it felt like weeks, after my first arrival in Darkover my
head was still swimming from Grandmother's flurry of words, instructions and
introductions.  I was sitting in my room, gazing out the window onto a
spectacular view.  I had precious little to put away, though that hardly
seemed to matter as my room was apparently prepared for me.  There were
books, clothes, and a few items that were alarmingly to my taste if
different then the exact styles I was used to.
Pulling Brand's cloak from my shoulders to put it away, I remembered the
small package tucked into my case again.  With a grin, I sat down on the bed
and began unwrapping it immediately.
Inside, I found a square of parchment paper carefully wound around a small
cloth envelope.  Unfolding the paper, I noted Brand's script,
"And so I can but ask.  It is, of course your choice.  What cannot be in one
way..."
Mystified, I opened the little envelope to find a gold ring tumble out onto
my hand.  It was lightly engraved with a motiff of vines and leaves in
delicate fairy lines.  The ring was encircled with a band of emerald stone,
set into the gold.  The craftsmanship was supurb.  Staring delightedly, I
noticed light catch on writing over the vines on the inside curve as I
turned it.  Glancing inside, I found the inscription.
Neither Owner nor Owned, Neither Keeper Nor Kept,
Yet Bound as one my Soul with thine, In love Eternal you are Mine.
 
My choice, he'd written, as if he could ever think otherwise!  I pulled out
his trump instinctively, then stopped.  I had been told something about not
being able to use trumps from here.  I tried it anyway, but there was no
response, the card never even grew cold.  Sighing, I supposed I'd have to
wait for an opportunity to ask Grandmother how to go about such things.
While I thought about good excuses for why I wanted to make a trump contact
to my uncle, I found a gold chain I had had for a long time.  Threading it
through the ring, I hung it around my neck, under my tunic.  Yes, I would
accept.
Time passed, and my lessons began in earnest.  I found myself glad I had
accepted the offer and I strove to please Grandmother as I could.  I held
her in awe; she seemed to know just about everything.  I had not realized
that up to that point my awe of her kept her seperate from me, someone to be
revered and respected.  But I had not come to think of her as friend or
family.  That was soon to change.
Finally, I got up the courage to ask her about a way to call Brand.  I
approached Grandmother almost shyly, not sure how to proceed.  Her
expression was grave as she worked, letting me try to explain myself clumsily.
"Grandmother, I understand that my trumps will not work from here.  How may
I contact one of my kinsmen?"
Her hands were busy as she seperated herbs in her workshop.  "What, child,
is of so great import?  Did you want to speak with your father perhaps?"
I flinched in distaste, though I knew she must be teasing me.  Surely she
knew well by now how I felt about him.  "No Domna, not him!"
"Then your Aunt Florimel I would guess?  You have spoken so fondly of her..."
My agony showed in my voice, I am certain.  "I wish to speak to...um...my
uncle.  Your son Brand."
"You seem troubled chiya.  Is this something I can help you with?"
I fidgeted slightly, "It is...personal.  I'm sorry.  Is there a way?"
She turned to regard me, and now I saw the humor in her eyes.
"We are family, surely you can share a personal trouble?"
Mutely I stared at my feet in misery, not sure if I had already condenmed us.
She laid her fingertips lightly on my hand, "Your Grandfather, dear man
though he could be, is a barbarian dear.  If you are so uncomfortable, of
course I will not pry.  But know this...this is not Amber chiya."
I looked up at her, an unfamiliar emotion filling my thoughts; hope.
"Then you" I asked carefully, "will not be angry with whom I am close?"
Grandmother returned to her herb sorting, her voice mild.
"Your Grandfather has no appreciation for maintaining a good genetic line.
I see he still has you all living in fear of some primitive mating taboos.
It's perfectly natural, dear, to love someone with whom you have grown
close, as long as you are mindful of your duty to keep a diversity in
overall genetic pools."  She looked down at me again, where I stood with my
mouth hanging open.
"Does that answer your questions chiya?"
Impulsively, I reached out and hugged her, a gesture which seemed to catch
her by surprise.  She stiffened, then relaxed, patting my shoulder.
I pulled the ring out from my tunic happily, showing it to her.  She nodded
slowly.
"I see.  Though you didn't say so, that is what I had thought.  I am glad
you feel you can share this with me now.  Trust is important here, it is one
of the keystones of your learning here."  She turned away from her work,
leading me towards the door of the workshop.
"You have much to unlearn Celeste.  But first, let me try to contact him for
you.  Remember," she warned me as we headed for the stairs, "your lessons
here will always come first".
"Grandmother" I asked, confused, "isn't there a way for me to contact him
myself."
She sighed heavily, and her eyes were sad when they touched mine.
"No, I am sorry Celeste.  He is difficult to reach, and you are not ready
yet to learn this.  I will explain to you when you are more ready.  Perhaps
in time you may do so."  With that I had to be content.
Evidently she was successful in reaching him, for it was only a few short
weeks until he arrived.  Clarissa insisted on taking Brand aside for a short
talk to which I was not privy.  And while I fussed and worried, I need not
have.  I was summoned to her sitting room shortly.  Brand stood, enfolding
me in a gentle hug until Grandmother cleared her throat.
"Sit chiya, we have something to discuss" she said softly.  He released me
and we sat, my hands in his.  Her gaze on me was gentle and I waited
patiently while she just watched for a moment.
When she spoke her tone was formal.  I felt myself almost unconsciously
straighten up in response.
"Brand has come to me, as is proper, and has asked my permission and my
blessing to take your hand in marriage.  Tell me chiya, is this your will as
well?  Will this make you happy?"
"Oh yes Grandmother, yes it will."
She raised a hand, "Do you truly understand what it is you do?  Do you know
how hard this will be child?  Only here can you be free with each other,
nowhere else will you be able to be such to each other for fear of discovery
from Oberon's brood.  Have you considered the possibilities if you are not
careful?"
Brand paled but looked determined.  I nodded, "I understand Grandmother.  I
have lived in hiding so long...even this is more than I could haved dared
hope for."
She gazed at us almost sadly for a moment, then held out her hands.
"You have chosen, then it shall be so.  Come kneel here, let me give you my
blessing."
We both moved forward, kneeling to either side and she placed her hands one
on each of our heads.
"May this bring you happiness...and some measure of peace."
I glanced up curious to see those last words directed at Brand.  His eyes
met hers and I had the impression that some unspoken understanding passed
between them briefly.
And so Brand and I came to be betrothed in Darkover, against all reasonable
designs on safety or sense.

From: "A Page in the Life of ..." <dkap@haven.org>
 
-=> First is the rewrite of Dangerous Ground.  It needed some additions and
-=> polishing (especially adding the stuff about the gifts).
-=> Second is the 'engagement' segment.  Wedding segment to follow.  It was
-=> getting long and unwieldy, so I broke it up into two seperate stories.  This
-=> will mean redoing the index, however...
-=>
-=> Dangerous Ground
-=>
-=> It was almost three months after my 'funeral' that I realized the truth.  It
-=> came as a complete but wonderful shock to me.  Still, I was chagrined not to
-=> be the first to know.  I rushed off to tell Grandmother, only to have her
-=> give me a warm but perplexed smile.
-=> "Why yes dear, I was wondering when you would come tell me.  I thought you
-=> knew already."
-=> Later in my studies I would learn a much greater awareness and control, but
-=> at the time that was still in my future.  Grandmother correctly interpreted
-=> my actions and stopped me from rushing off to try to find Brand immediately.
-=> "He'll be back.  Let him come on his own.  He'll be in a much better
-=> mindset.  Besides, you have work to do, and what good would he be just
-=> sitting around all that time?"  It was difficult to hear but I minded her
-=> all the same.  Another two months would slip by before I heard from him, a
-=> long and endless two months.  Grandmother always admonished me the same when
-=> I got edgy waiting.
-=> "Patience Celeste.  You must learn patience.  We'll find him if it's necessary."
-=> Brand did return, wandering into the garden where I sat having tea with
-=> Grandmother one late morning.  His entry explained her small enigmatic
-=> smile.  He was, as she had predicted, in a light, airy mood and carrying
-=> several packages.
-=> "Good morning" he nodded pleasantly, "may I join you?  I have found the most
-=> amazing..."
-=> As he drew near at Grandmother's nod his words faltered, eyes growing wider
-=> as they fell on me.  A dozen different emotions flickered across his face,
-=> panic and astonishment among them. He dropped the packages as he rushed
-=> over, sweeping me out of the chair.
-=> "Celeste!  You didn't tell me!  When?" he exclaimed, finally releasing me
-=> from the embrace. I smiled, delighted to have seen him so speechless.
-=> "It's been a little over five months.  Grandmother says she's a girl."
-=> His eyes narrowed to slightly wary.
-=> "No one knows, do they?" he asked anxiously.
-=> A throat cleared from behind us.
-=> "No dear, of course not.  And you must be very careful to keep it that way,
-=> if you want that child to survive.  Here, naturally, she's safe."
-=> Grandmother stood, holding her tea cup.  "You can't give your father any
-=> reason to even get a little suspicious Brand."
-=> His face paled slightly, but he nodded looking back to me.
-=> "She's right.  Darkover is the safest place for the two of you."  He sat
-=> down, holding both my hands in his.  Grandmother walked out through the
-=> archway, smiling.
-=> The baby squirmed and I pulled his hand to my stomach. He sat unmoving, his
-=> eyes fairly glowed.
-=> "Are you happy?" I asked quietly.
-=> "Whenever you are" he murmured.
-=> We sat in the garden talking until we were summoned for supper.
-=> After supper, Brand went and retrieved the almost forgotten packages.  His
-=> mannerism was almost shy though his eyes were shining.
-=> He went first to Clarissa, he was learning custom quickly!, offering her one
-=> of the wrapped packages.
-=> "A small gift for your collection...Mother" he murmured, bending quickly to
-=> kiss her lightly on the cheek.
-=> She favored him with a warm smile, opening the package as he sat near me.
-=> The wrappings fluttered away under her hands to reveal a lovely box covered
-=> in inlaid gold panels.  She turned it over, caressing it lightly with her
-=> hands and it responded with a faint click, four of the panels sliding into
-=> new configurations.  Her eyebrows arched as she looked back to Brand.
-=> "A true puzzle-box.  Very unusual, thank you.  It is a most interesting and
-=> worthy gift.  I will...investigate this later."
-=> Brand looked pleased with himself and with the compliment.  He turned to me,
-=> handing me the other package.
-=> "For you love."  He glanced up at Clarissa, who nodded approval.  Mystified,
-=> I opened it eagerly.  Inside, I was delighted to find a hair clip.  Crafted
-=> in gleaming copper, it was in the form of a hunting hawk, Brand's septicle
-=> clasped in one upheld claw and it's wings outspread as if about to take
-=> flight.  Emeralds were set as its eyes, and a scattering of dark star
-=> sapphire chips made it look as though a hundred stars were reflecting from
-=> it's feathers.  It was delicate and beautiful and I gasped in delight.
-=> Brand glanced at Clarissa, who again nodded permission.  He took it gently
-=> and carefully clasped it behind my head, replacing the hair clip fastened
-=> there.  There was a faint tingling sensation that made me glance at him
-=> curiously, a faint flush of pleasure on my cheeks.  He smiled, pleased at my
-=> reaction.
-=> "I wanted to give you an appropriate gift" he said softly, "do you like it?"
-=> "It is perfect" I assured him.
-=> Grandmother stood up.  "I have some things to do, children, I assume you can
-=> entertain yourselves?"  With a dismissive smile, she left holding the box
-=> carefully, a thoughtful look on her face.  We sat by the fireside for a
-=> time, then retired for an early evening.
-=> Although he came and went briefly (often returning with gifts for the baby)
-=> Brand stayed in Darkover for the next 4 months.  Grandmother was quite
-=> tolerant as long as my lessons and her schedule were not overly interrupted.
-=> She seemed to think as long as he minded his place, he belonged with us.
-=> Her opinions of him had been colored over time by mine, and she was far more
-=> accepting of him than she had been in the past.  She came to treat him as
-=> family, and though he never said so I could feel that this made him happy
-=> but saddened him at the same time.
-=> Grandmother taught me a great deal about contolling one's own body and
-=> energies during that time, seemingly trying to make up for what she
-=> considered an oversight.  I became far more sensitive to flows of energy in
-=> the body, and was thrilled to become closer to my daughter before she was
-=> born.  I became much more sensitive to Brand's moods and feelings as well,
-=> though he seemed so much more self-assured in Darkover.
 
If you want to let this develope into a trumplink between you two when you
are in Darkover ... I'll allow it.  It was crafted by Darkstar for you, of
course ...
 
-=> It was sometime during this period that it finally occurred to me what was
-=> so different about him. The shifting, dangerous moods were completely absent
-=> and I finally dredged up the corage to question him about it.
-=> "Brand?" I started hesitantly, soon after rising one morning.  "You
-=> seem...so much happier here.  It's almost like...well...like you're a
-=> different person now.  Not in a bad way" I added quickly, "just...different."
-=> He looked at me sharply and I caught the echoes of pain in his eyes.
-=> "We all make our choices, but I can't talk about it Celeste.  I'm sorry.  If
-=> it makes you feel better, I am happy here with you."
-=> I paused, trying a different approach, "Then maybe we could just, well, stay..."
-=> I was distracted as he snapped his fingers, standing suddenly.
-=> "Hey, don't we have some work to do in that room you're turning into a
-=> nursery?  We're running out of time.  You wanted it finished this week, right?"
-=> "Uh, yeah I did.  Did you have some more ideas?" I asked him, slightly confused.

-=> Ok David.  This is going to be very, very long.
                                                                                     
No it's not, I'm goingto chunkify it.
                                                                                     
-=> First of all, I need to get the timeline straight.
                                                                                     
Timeline.  Agreed.  All years measured as comparied to Amber, except when
stated otherwise.
                                                                                     
-=> Celeste -
-=> Born in Erelorne, lived there till the age of 5
-=> Taken to Amber by Bleys.  Lived there, what, 40 years?
                                                                                     
Hmm ... is 40 years enough for you to have gotten in all you wanted to?
And not too much for you to have gotten bored and jaded yet?  I had imaged
closer to 25-30, but 40 will do.
                                                                                     
-=> Goes to Darkover.  Stays there from Earth time circa Black Plague Era until
-=> x? years pre Patternfall?
                                                                                     
Nah much earlier than the Black Plague ... Corwin was only gone some 350
years in Amber, you would be gone significantly more than that.  I worked
it out for Paulette and Damiana, ask Tia when you would be about 40, since
you were born between Random and Mirelle.
                                                                                     
-=> Leaves Darkover, goes into shadow, eventually to Manhome.  Joins Agents of
-=> Chance???  Is there for ?? years

Amber time about a year before the series begins.
 
-=> Returns to Darkover for a time  xx? years?
-=> Clarissa takes in Mikhail.  Celeste returns to shadow.  timing please?
 
Umm ... Clarissa freeing Oberon (and producing Mikail and Paolo) was the
reason she had wrapped up your tutalage when she did.  You didn't go away
and return, you spent the interveaning time there.  That's why noone else
even had an inkling that yo uwere alive, and why you could grow so attached
to Brand, and why Clarissa knew enough (from Brand unawars) to free Oberon,
and why Mikail was such a rush job (he needed to be ready in time).
 
-=> Called back to Darkover just before Patternfall War, about 3-4 months before?
-=> Stays in Darkover about 6 months?
-=> Travels shadow, hunting out and killing Caines for xx? years
 
I believe it is 5.5 years after Patternfall.
 
-=> Present day - returning to Amber

Faythe might have brought this one to you in tears.  A little tragedy won't
hurt for her.  And when you go after the killer, Faythe will insist that it
was an accident all the way through.  You mgiht think it is her nievite,
about the circumstances, but instead she is telling you that he was the
wrong person, that the murder was misspointed.  But you won't get that
until the end, after you have made some irretrivable action against his
murderers.

-=> A Little Faythe
-=>
-=> Faythe was born quietly, with little fanfare, at 3:40 in the morning.  I
-=> recall hearing stormwinds howling outside, Darkover gripped in the dead of
-=> winter.  Brand stayed by my side throughout and Grandmother herself
-=> attented to me.  With the techniques she had taught me, however, it was not
-=> the terrible ordeal I had feared childbirth to be.
 
Nope, Clarissa's tower is in the overworld.  While there might be
stormwinds below ... it would always be peaceful in the overworld.
 
-=> She was, even to my prejudiced eye, a beautiful child bearing all the marks
-=> of one of Clarissa's line.  Even from birth though, her eyes were her
-=> father's.  Brand was so very proud of her.  He held her ever so carefully
-=> with tears in his eyes the first hour she was alive.  Grandmother left us
-=> alone as soon as was prudent after the birth and we held her together while
-=> she slept sharing a quiet unspoken joy.
-=> Time, ever our enemy even in those peaceful years, flew by us blindingly
-=> fast.  Faythe grew from a happy baby into an inquisitive and delightful
-=> child.  Between the three of us no effort was ever wasted in her education.
-=>  Grandmother saw to it her training was begun early.  Brand and I added to
-=> her teaching in our own way, always emphasizing how strongly she was loved
-=> and wanted.  There was something poignant and almost desperate in Brand's
-=> devotion to her,.  I came to realize and learn that we were both trying so
-=> hard to give her what we had never had; loving, caring and dedicated parents.
-=> Her presence only enhanced our life together.  Her quick mind and love of
-=> learning was a joy to experience.  She florished under all that attention,
-=> and it was a wonder she never grew spoiled but she wasn't demanding or
-=> selfish.  To the contrary, she remained sweet and accepting to the point of
-=> utter unselfishness.
 
You weren't the only ones to spoil her, some of the other priestess, who
had a tendency to visit Clarissa's tower in the overworld, would always
lavish attention on her.
                                                                                     
-=> Grandmother seemed to take a special interest in Brand's fixated devotion.
-=> Though she never really commented on it, it seeme to please and in some way
-=> amuse her.
-=> Faythe was nearly eight when Brand and Clarissa had their first major clash
-=> over her.  Brand was so possessive of Faythe, but up to that point had
-=> gracefully allowed Clarissa (not that it would likely have mattered) her
-=> way in education and guidance.
-=> At Faythe's seventh birthday, Brand had brought her a horse, a small saddle
-=> mare really, and of course Faythe wanted to become a skilled rider with all
-=> the exhuberance of a child.  She patiently endured the months of intensive
-=> riding lessons that were foisted off on her.  She knew already how to care
-=> for the animal, but both Brand and Clarissa wanted to be very secure in how
-=> she could handle the mare alone.
 
Hmm ... probably also the first of her excursions out of the overworld.
 
-=> Brand finally decided she had reached an appropriate level of skill, and
-=> announced after breakfast that he was going to take Faythe out for a long
-=> ride to go exploring.  Curious, I asked where they were heading, and was a
-=> little shocked to hear Brand off-handedly say it was time for Faythe to
-=> 'get out' and 'see the real world' and so on.  Faythe was delighted, but
-=> Clarissa stood up from her chair like a cloud of thunder and forbid him to
-=> do any such foolish thing with her granddaughter.  (The family lines
-=> blurred a little, and Faythe's relation to Clarissa would change depending
-=> to whom Clarissa was talking at the time).  Brand's temper erupted.  Poor
-=> Faythe, caught in the middle, burst into tears thinking this was all her
-=> fault.  Grandmother bid me to take her to the gardens while she
-=> 'straightened this idiocy out once and for all'.  Brand was just glaring at
-=> her, ignoring us completely, so with a sigh I did as I was told.  As we
-=> were leaving I caught Clarissa's next words, dripping with icy venom.
-=> "Does your shattered memory serve you that feebly then to forget so many
-=> risks to your daughter?!"
 
Umm ... she wouldn't take that tact, not at first.  She would simply ask
him what method he had chosen for his daughter's death in front of Oberon.
 
-=> I winced and rushed Faythe quickly out of earshot of that battle.  She was
-=> terribly hurt and confused, and I thought that never would it be a better
-=> time to educate her about the politics of Amber.  I knew that Clarissa was
-=> heading for more than just that, but it would do.  We spent the afternoon
-=> in the aviary.
 
Which aviary?  Did you go down out of the Overworld?  Did you go to take
care of the Mare, stabled in one of the free amazon's houses?  Or one of
the Midwife houses?
 
-=>  I calmed her down, carefully explaining that it was
-=> certainly not her fault and that there were factors she was not yet aware
-=> of.  Of course, she knew of Amber and of how we were all interrelated, but
-=> she was Darkover born and raised and thought nothing of it.  Now I taught
-=> her the truth behind Amber's politics and laws and she was naturally
-=> disgusted.  Darkovan through and through, Oberon's laws were at first
-=> confusing and nonsensical to her.  I could well sympathize with her
-=> disbelief.  It had taken me some time to adjust to Darkover's cultural
-=> differences, and I had never quite done so fully I was sure.  How barbaric
-=> it must have seemed to her the other way around, to be forbidden to be
-=> close to your beloved family.  But Faythe was intelligent and quick of wit.
-=>  Reluctantly she finally conceeded understanding, though she was disgusted
-=> with it and said she could never agree to it.  How she must learn to
-=> conduct herself should she ever leave Darkover was crystal clear to her.
-=> She thought it rather amusing.
-=> It was never clearer to me what Clarissa had meant when she so carefully
-=> warned me to be sure what I was doing.  Her words came back to me, 'Do you
-=> understand how hard it will be?', and now I saw what whe had truly meant.
-=> I hadn't fully understood then, and now I feared I did.
-=> Brand eventually joined us in the aviary, subdued and looking fairly
-=> miserable.  Faythe bounded over to him with a gentle hug that melted huge
-=> chinks in his mood.
-=> "Father dearest, of <i>course</i> I understand!" she told him sincerely.
-=> "Let us go riding in the hills instead.  We can take the hawks and go
-=> hunting!  I certainly don't want to wander around in some barbarian's back
-=> yard and meet that terrible old tyrant who thinks it's wrong for me to even
-=> give you a kiss!"
-=> Brand laughed merrily at this, sweeping her into a bear hug.  They did go
-=> out hunting, returning late the next day in marvelous spirits.  Faythe
-=> fairly bubbled over about their wonderful adventure, any disappointment she
-=> may have felt about not going into shadow long forgotten.  Brand nearly
-=> glowed with pride, and he seemed well over it too.
 
Even though he carfully ignored the pointed look Clarissa would have shot
him.
-=> That in essence is Faythe, then and now.  That wild, carefree joy in
-=> everything she does has never dulled over the years, nor has her compassion
-=> or gentleness of spirit.  She is still the best thing I have from our life
-=> together and I sleep better knowing her to be safe in Darkover under
-=> Clarissa's watchful care.
 
Don't forget about the funny story Faythe told you about, while out riding
Brand said he could make the cliff closer after they jumped, hand in hand.
They plummeted for a bit (much to Brand's chagrin, but she wouldn't know
that) and then they floated up the other face, which was no closer.

Oh ... a note on the riding lesson ... It just occured to me, that when he
mentioned ttaking her off through shadow?  No matter how much you love him,
you had a twinge, in your head, that he was going to do to you what you did
to your mother.  Anyway ... on to the next.
 
-=> Legacy
-=>
-=> Faythe was still a girl of only 13 when Grandmother first spoke to me of
-=> having more children.  Brand and I had not managed a second child yet,
-=> though not for lack of trying!  Even with Clarissa's training, there was
-=> always something slightly wrong that we couldn't seem to overcome.
-=> Sometimes I'd be sure we had, only to discover in a day or a week that
-=> certainly slip away from me.
 
It was something about the fact that it took a piece of your essence to
kindle life into the cells that were trying to grow.  Being amberites
(especially due to the fact that he had already walked the pattern) your
essense is bound that much more greatly to you, and splitting of a section
of it for a child is no easy task.
                                                                                     
-=> I was summoned to Clarissa's sitting room where it seemed all important
-=> discussions were always held.  Brand and Faythe were off somewhere riding
-=> and my day had been a relatively quiet one of working in the gardens.
                                                                                     
Probably, at 13 Faythe was working in the fields of some farmer down on the
world below, secretly, helping along the growth of the harvest with her
"green mother" talent (call it plant empathy).  It helps drain off the
pressure if she uses it, otherwise, during puberty, she is going to ... umm
... have a rough time of it would be an understatement.  And Brand would be
off in Shadow somewhere.  He didn't spend THAT much time in Darkover.
Months at a time at the most, but usually just a few days or a week.  It
added up to a lot of time, but none of it was all at once.  THe longest
stay was from when he found out you were pregnant, thorough a month or so
after her birth.
 
-=> "Chiya, sit with me" she began, and I was certain then the talk was to be
-=> serious.  "I have decided it time for you to have a son."
-=> "Grandmother, we have tried!" I exclaimed.  "You know of the difficulty
-=> I've..."
-=> She waved me silent.  "No child.  Not with Brand."
-=> The words hung in the air between us and I could feel them almost tangible.
-=>  I stared at her.  Of course by now I had become well versed in Darkovan
-=> custom and belief, but I wasn't ready for this.  I drew myself up formally.
-=> "With all respect due, Domna, I cannot.  There is no other I love, nor do I
-=> wish to at this time."
-=> "And that is exactly why you will" she retorted.  "I didn't tell you to
-=> find another to share your love with!  Sex is a physcial act, a thing of
-=> pleasure.  It is made something more by your love, but it is not in itself
-=> an act of love.  Heavens, girl, you are sometimes still so naive!  Children
-=> are important, they are our legacy.  You would be seriously remiss to limit
-=> your genetic influence to children by only one father" she scolded.
-=> "But" I cried desperately, "I don't want to raise someone else's child!  I
-=> don't want to birth children who aren't wanted!"
-=> Grandmother's expression softened slightly, though her tone did not.
-=> "If that is all that is so worrisome to you, then we will simply foster the
-=> child to other relations who have not been so fortunate.  He will be raised
-=> by a family that wants and loves him."
-=> I buried my face in my hands, not wanting to face this.  "But...Brand.  How
-=> will I explain to him?  He is not of Darkover, he won't..." I faltered.
-=> I sensed rather than saw her shaking her head.  "Child, you have so far
-=> still to go.  Have you learned nothing?  Did I teach you such utter
-=> nonsense and lack of confidence in yourself?"  She sighed heavily.  "Do you
-=> truly think your <i>beloved</i> so shallow, that he would love you less if
-=> another touched you?  Do you think he is so selfish to begrudge you
-=> pleasure or happiness?  You are closely related and your pairing has not
-=> been overly fertile.  Do you think he would hate you for giving him another
-=> child by a different sire?"
-=> My head snapped up, fury in my eyes.  "No, of course not!  We..."  I
-=> stopped, confused, my thoughts racing.
-=> "Then perhaps you are ashamed to share pleasure?  Do you fear that you will
-=> enjoy it?  Will it lessen your pleasure with Brand if you do?  Are you
-=> afraid that he too will find another?  Do you think he'll not return to you?"
-=> "I..." I stammered, my face flushed with anger and confusion.
                                                                                     
And a brief memory of what Fiona ... shared with you.
 
-=> "Does this embarrass you Celeste?  Can you not discuss this?" Grandmother's
-=> voice was harsh and cutting.  "Does Brand <i>own</i> you?"
-=> It was a calculated remark designed to strike home and it did.
-=> "No" I said angrily.
-=> "Will you ever go to Amber again, girl?  Will you ever attend any social
-=> functions there?  Or will you avoid those relations the rest of your life?
-=> Will you cleverly dodge every statemen who courts your affections, every
-=> courtier who makes a friendly advance?  Political alliances are often
-=> forged between the sheets, and stop looking so shocked Celeste.  There are
-=> advantages to accepting a political marriage or a contract for producing
-=> heirs with a short-lived shadow dweller.  What would you say to avoid such
-=> a thing?  Will you tell your father and grandfather that you can't, you're
-=> already married?  Will you introduce your beloved lifemate to them?"
-=> I was speechless.  I stared at her in misery.
-=> "And what of those who would use your naive loyalty to injure one or both
-=> of you?  You would be a wonderful tool to destroy Brand or lure him into
-=> entrapment.  How could he not fall for such a ploy, knowing that all they
-=> had to do was rape you to destroy you, that such a simple act would be so
-=> devestatingly destructive to your delicate emotional state?" Grandmother's
-=> words fairly dripped with sarcasm.  "Since you cannot seperate your love
-=> from a physical act, don't you think you'd broadcast your torment like a
-=> beacon?  And if something should happen to him, then will you spend the
-=> rest of your life alone?  Unable to experience even pleasure?"
-=> I started to cry then and almost didn't feel her come to me for comfort.
-=> "Chiya, you need to learn to understand the seperation of physical pleasure
-=> from the emotional and spiritual linking you share in your love.  Don't you
-=> see?  Only then can you be free to love without fear."
-=> Crying softly, I nodded slowly.  I did understand, and I realized that I
-=> never had before.
 
Well hammered.  Excelent choices.
 
-=> Softly, she added "And Fiona will be able to hurt you so much less."
-=> I looked up in horror, not having been aware that she knew that.  She
-=> patted my hand gently, dismissing the revelation as if it were nothing.
-=> "I will speak to Brand.  For now though, let us move on.  I must tell you
-=> where to go and what you will do there.  This is the fun part, I believe
-=> you will find some humor in it."
                                                                                     
Umm ... she would have given you some time to get used to it ... probably 6
months or so.  Then she would have brought it up again.  When you had time
to think and let it become part of your actions, so that when you went down
to collect Faythe (she isn't old enough yet to transition on her own, so
you had been dropping her off, and picking her up, after the first few
times when she "could do it all on my on mommy, aren't you proud of me?"
you would occasionally look at the other men then, wondering which, if any,
Domma would arrange for.  Then which ones you wouldn't hate, and finally
which ones would be pleasant.
 
Then she would drop the other shoe.
 
-=> Unhappily, then with growing amazement and amusement, I listened as she
-=> explained the Dry Towners to me.  I had known of them and their enslaved
-=> women, of course, but not in the detail she gave me now.  Their treatment
-=> of women was a study in primitive sociology in a place like Darkover.
-=> She explained how she sent her daughters into their region, daughters who
-=> so exactly resembled their ideal of the perfect slave, to capture men for
-=> stud in the manner they used to capture and enslave women.  It was so like
-=> Clarissa to turn the tables on those arrogant males and further degrade
-=> them by using them solely as breeding stock.  I felt I needed to question
-=> their value in the breeding pool if they were so backwards and her look was
-=> approving.
-=> "A good thought Celeste dear, but they have a strong and useful genetic
-=> pool from which we can produce good children.  They can be raised and
-=> trained in a proper environment and brought to their full potential.  Only
-=> leaving children there in that social cesspool would be criminal, not
-=> interbreeding with decent stock."
 
The only redeaming point of their culture, is that they looked at breeding
as an improvement program, unlike the rest of the humans there, who did it
for position or love or the like.  So they were perhaps the best stock
available.  And one didn't want to break up the culture, just reap it's
benefits.
 
-=> And I did understand, finally.  She sent me off to prepare for my 'hunt'.
-=> A short while after I'd gone upstairs I heard a commotion in the lower hall
-=> that could only be Brand and Faythe returning.  I paused, listening, but no
-=> steps rang out on the stairs, no voices were raised in greeting.  I could
-=> only assume that Grandmother had ambused them on the way in to give me time
-=> alone.  I was grateful, I needed it.  Servants brought my dinner to my
-=> rooms and I was left to eat in peace, staring out the window contemplatively.
 
Matter of fact, she waited a little longer than she would have normally
thought wise (you were beginning to look at them as if they were cattle,
and that is a bad habit to get into) but she was waiting for Brand to
respond to her gentle pressure.  He had apparently arrived while you were
setting Faythe up for the night, for it was he rather than Clarissa who
greated you apon your return.  One look and you knew Clarissa had told him
what you were going to embark on.
 
-=> Later that evening Brand came to me.  By then I was sure he knew and I was
-=> nervous what his reaction would be.  His step as he entered the room was
-=> soft so I knew he was not angry but I still could not meet his eyes.
-=> Gently he came over and drew me down to sit beside him on the bed.
-=> "Celeste" he said softly, turning my face to his, "look at me.  Such
-=> terribly wrong notions you have.  No one will ever love you as I do and I
-=> am so sure of your love for me.  Nothing can lessen this!"
-=> I looked into his eyes, seeing the belief and sincerety there, hoping it
-=> was genuine but still afraid.  He shook his head lightly.
-=> "No child you bear will ever go unwanted, no matter who the sire may be.
-=> Your children are part of you love, I will love them all the more because
-=> of that.  How could I not?  If they're of your blood, they're already of
-=> mine as well, aren't they?  You have been a wonderful mother.  I have
-=> worried that I could not give you that chance again.  I am glad for you to
-=> accept a new way to bring us more children.  I want you to be happy.  If
-=> you want this, then I want it for you.  Clarissa said you were disheartened
-=> after we tried for so long and failed.  Of course I don't mind!  How could
-=> you think I'd love you less?"
-=> I was amazed at Grandmother's subtle wordsmithing, but so relieved that he
-=> could accept this.  Exhaustion struck me down, and happy though I was I
-=> cried myself to sleep on his shoulder.
 
She wasn't in evidene for the rest of the night for some odd and unknown
reason. <grin>  You both probably went down to collect Faythe, and, of
course, she would want to show off for him, so you spent the day touring
the farmlands she had improved.
 
For dinnerBrand would have announced, that it was your turn to take a
vacation and he would be the one lucky enough to have Faythe to himself for
the next little while.  Of course he would be staying in "mommy's I mean
our" rooms.
 
-=> The next morning after breakfast I set out for the Dry Towns.  The journey
-=> itself was uneventful.  Grandmother understood their ways and habits too
-=> well for her plan to go wrong, and so it did not.  The duty before me was
-=> simple, and I started out to carry it out as just that, another job to be
-=> done.  I found it, however, not wholely distasteful as I'm sure
Grandmother
-=> had in mind.
 
You are, of course, not alone in this.  You would be a Comyn woman, being
escorted by a company of Free Amizons, and you would have to be captured
... otherwise you wouldn't be worth the effort.
 
-=> His name was Kerlac.  He was rough and vaguely crude, as I expected a
-=> workman to be, but he was not a cruel man.  I found his bluntness rather
-=> refreshing, and I dallied with him several days.  When I was quite sure
I'd
-=> had my fill of this new experience, and equally sure I was pregnant with a
-=> boy-child as I'd been taught, I took my leave of him.  We parted in good
-=> graces.  He actually told me he would miss e, and to look him up if I were
-=> coming into town again.  Oddly enough, I felt I would miss him too in a
-=> small way, but I did not feel love for him then or now, and he seemed to
-=> understand that well enough.  Grandmother's wisdom never ceases to amaze
me.
 
Umm ... it would take several weeks for him to make sure you were "docile"
enough for his tastes to take you to is bed, and not worry that you will
try to kill him.  You could play it either way ... break him to your will,
privately of course, so he still will have dignaty, or play complacient and
delighted to be actually worth capturing, and fighting for the right to be
his "first" woman both choices will take some time.  Either way, he will
become enamored with you, claim you as the best, and be most sorry at your
being "recaptured en route to visit another powerful Dry Towner who had
promiced protection along the way."  He did invite you to revisit him any
time, though.  And laughted at the thought that his decendents might be on
the throan of the Coucil someday.
 
-=> I soon decided that I could not foster away the child after all, to my
-=> chagrin and Clarissa's knowing smile.  Faythe wanted to learn about
-=> childbirth and midwifery, and we all felt it better that she have a
-=> positive experience and so she was taught.  This way too everyone was
-=> present at Brendon's birth and again I found it to be no great ordeal,
-=> though it was somewhat more difficult than with Faythe.
                                                                                     
When you returned, Brand was both reluctant and itching to be gone (as
usual) but promised (of course) to be back in time for the birthing.
 
-=> Brendon was a serious, intense child with secrets in the shadows of his
-=> midnight blue eyes.  Faythe adored him, devoting herself to her younger
-=> brother with her usual charm, and he came to accept this with a quiet
-=> deliberation.  He treated all displays of affection in that manner all his
-=> life, with a solemn attention that was somewhat frightening.
-=> Grandmother said once in a vaguely troubled tone that he remineded her a
-=> great deal of one of her own children when they were young, but refused to
-=> elaborate more on that.  I worried sometimes that something was
-=> fundamentally wrong, like it were eating away at him inside, and could
tell
-=> that Brand had similar misgivings.
 
Not so dark.  Maybe given to bursts of passion (very angry, very happy,
very depressed, very loving, you know, extreems) in different directions.
And Clarissa would have no reall misgivings about children.  Remember, she
still regards you and Brand as children, this one is still very much in the
proto stage.  Faythe was a special case, but then again, Faythe was always
special.
 
-=> Brendon became a rather talented artist.  His work was, predictably, dark
-=> and disturbing but showed true genius.  We encouraged his endeavors, which
-=> he seemed appreciative of.  It always felt as though we were never quite
-=> reaching him on some level.  Little did we realize then how correct those
-=> feelings and intuition were.
 
Hmm ... his works were as deep as his emotions, and as broad.  He could
turn his hand ot just about any artistic endevor, but none of them held his
interest for long.  It would be as if he had something to express, but
couldn't find the medium to express it in.
 
-=> Faythe remained, as always, untouched by her brother's brooding nature and
-=> showered honest affection on him.  I always hoped she would prove a good
-=> influence on him, but it seemed only to spur him to reactions of jealousy
-=> and resentment.  He never took it out on her, but he did not respond
-=> either.  He learned early, of course, that Brand was his father only in
-=> name as we did not lie to out children, not that it would be easy to do so
-=> in Darkover.  Curiously enough, this knowledge drove him to try to develop
-=> the strongest relationship with Brand, and to seek more and more
-=> extravagant ways to impress him and win the acceptance he could never
quite
-=> believe he had.
 
No jealousy or resentment, just ... an unreachability about him.
 
-=> Brand was true to his word and was a good father to Brendon, whom he had
-=> named himself.  Brendon was, in turn, ever suspicious of Brand's
-=> intentions.  Brendon's mistrustful nature was a strong blow to Brand and I
-=> and though we tried and tried, he was never willing to let us be his
-=> friends.  I regret that we must have failed him somehow, and only later
-=> would we become so accutely aware of how completely he was lost to us.
 
Brendon's fluxuations would have troubled Brand, but he would never speak of
it.  Brendon would never be mistrustful of his parents, but his wild
changes in behaviour .. well ... Brand didn't like being around them.  He
spent the shortest amount of time in Darkover when Brandon was being
raised.  It wasn't he didn't visit, it was just that his visits were
shorter.
 
This of course made it much wworse for him, when he found out Brandon was
dead.  Brand had always figrued on reconsiling with his own problem and
then reconciling wiht Brandon, and there just wasn't enough time.
 
Speeking of time ... This might want to occure later in Fayth's life (and
your stay)  Or have Faythe born later to the both of you.  Faythe being of
amberite blood could be hitting puberty at 25 or 30 (somewhat delayed due
to Clarissa's presence, and her eternal attempte to teach you patience.

I expect it.  It helps round out the character.  From my less experienced

-=> >IMPORTANT NOTE HERE!!!  This is BEFORE Brand dies, so she's not psycho

-=> definately fixed that in place.  I figured, cops don't hate those who go
on
-=> mass murder sprees and wipe out the socially useless, but they still have
-=> to solve the cases and bring them to justice.  And even the best
-=> intentioned vigilantes sometimes get the wrong one.  So I figure this is
-=> what she was up to...and then joined the agency with the whole bit about
-=> having to work on her own unsolved cases and all.  I do not see the

-=> would have to have a reason, some injustice (to her mind) or wrongdoing.
-=> Maybe she was after child molesters, or slavers, or guys who beat their
-=> wives, or something.  Perhaps after people abusing mental powers and the
-=> like.  Something, but not for no reason.  Your thoughts?
 
That's why I had the mass murder pegged as in respoince to the sight of
Brand destroying people, theoretically for information, but as far as you
could tell, just in revenge, so you are trying to find out what they didd,
and manage to kill lots of them.  Then you are recruited as an agent of
change, the police (called mounties or rangers) are a public face, do
gooders the lot of them.  You are the people sent in (at least you think
there is more than one other of you, you have met one other) when it isn't
going to be clean.  When the police would be getting their hands dirty.
The Police come in and clean up after you, adn some scape-gote, or even a
few times a non-existant person played by you get's captured, shipped
offworld to Secondus and "brought to justice"  Of course, you are already
out on another asignment, the necessary clips having already been filmed on
the transport, if you are involved.
 
-=> >>-=> -Revenge - Celeste, close to the edge, goes hunting Caines in shadow
-=> >>Hmm in 5.5 years?  You only will get one Caine, plus that Wiley E. Cyote
-=> fellow.
-=> >Well, she has no REASON to be Caine hunting until he shoots Brand.  What
-=> about fast time shadows?  I'm sure she could manage more than one or two
-=> Caines in 5 years.  She ought to be fairly deadly at this point from all
-=> the time she spent with the agency and as a vigilante.  I realize even a
-=> shadow of Caine is a nasty thing.
-=> >Here's a thought.  Clarissa taught her to be cold.  Could she find a
-=> shadow of Caine, seduce him, raise a kid in a fast time shadow (remember
-=> Dara?) and send the kid after Caine as well, as an added punch in the gut?
-=> That shouldn't be covered by Oberon's restrictions...
 
Umm ... she could have gotten real close to him physically, and killed him
in bed, just after sex, but if he is a true shadow of Caine, his taste in
sexuality is a bit ... brutal.  He's not really worried about safe, sane or
consentual, they are just shadows.  And besides, they might experience a
moment of true bliss ... A worthwhile shadow of Caine would have a way of
crossing shadow ... so probably would have the same disregards.  Besides,
he is a hell of a target, and you can continue to be on your "practice
safari"s during gamestart.
 
-=> >>-=> -Shame - Brendon's murder

-=> >
-=> >Nasty, I can work with that.  I'll get back to you on that one..I've got

Hmm ... I'll wait then.  Remember they are longer lived than the locals.
And so are you.
 
He's probably drifted through just about every profession, until he finally
finds one he thinks he could stick with ... then he can be killed.

What do you mean, what aviary?
The same aviary I wrote into the last three segments that mentioned
Darkover.  THAT aviary.
                                                                                     
Were you not paying attention to my impromptu aviary in the past?
And what on earth is wrong with an aviary in the overworld anyway?
Maybe they're very spiritual birds.

If you were complaining about not being able to reach Faythe ... it would
be like having a trump of her etched on the inside of your eyelids, and her
havign the same for you.  You would just have to close your eyes, feel the
cold feeling you feel when you trump someone, adn reach Faythe.  It could
be more than just shadow local, but it would take a lot more energy, and
you might only discover that by mistake, for Darkstar would have only told
you of it's local-shadow properties.  He might have implied that it was
Darkover specific.

Here's the rewrite for Legacy.  Please add final commentaries and changes.
Next revision gets posted.
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
Legacy
                                                                                    
Faythe grew up rather slowly, much I think due to Clarissa's influence on
her develpment.  At 22, she first began showing signs of entering her phase
of maturity.  I think Grandmother was just imparting to me one of her
endless lessons in patience, though she never directly said so.  I'd like to
think it eventually sank in.
                                                                                    
Faythe was still young at 23 when Grandmother first spoke to me of having
more children.  Brand and I had not managed a second child yet, though not
for lack of trying!  Even with Clarissa's training, there was always
something slightly wrong that we couldn't seem to overcome.  Sometimes I'd
be sure we had, only to discover in a day or a week that
certainly slip away from me.
                                                                                    
It was something, I learned later, about the fact that it took a piece of my
essence to kindle life into the cells that were trying to grow.  Being
Amberites (especially due to the fact that Brand had already walked the
pattern) my essense was bound that much more greatly to me, and splitting of
a section of it for a child was no easy task.  I can only assume now that
Faythe was the result of inexperienced energy control and extreme stress and
passion.  I once mentioned this theory to Grandmother; her response was just
a smile.
                                                                                    
I was summoned to Clarissa's sitting room where it seemed all important
discussions were always held.  Brand was off in shadow somewhere, having
been gone for most of a month.  Faythe was working on one of her hobbies,
her 'secret special projects' she called them.  I wasn't sure just what she
was up to then, though I wasn't worried, but we would later learn of her
tendancy to work in the fields of Darkover.  She enjoyed tending plants and
had a great talent for making them bloom and prosper.  Clarissa told me once
that it was a good direction for her to have taken, serving to drain off
excess energy and pressure that could have been a great stress to her while
fighting her way through the more strenuous developmental years.  Faythe
always seemed to instinctually find the right path.
 
"Chiya, sit with me" she began, and I was certain then the talk was to be
serious.  "I have decided it time for you to have a son."
"Grandmother, we have tried!" I exclaimed.  "You know of the difficulty
I've..."
She waved me silent.  "No child.  Not with Brand."
The words hung in the air between us and I could feel them almost tangible.
I stared at her.  Of course by now I had become well versed in Darkovan
customs and beliefs, but I wasn't ready for this.  I drew myself up formally.
"With all respect due, Domna, I cannot.  There is no other I love, nor do I
wish to at this time."
"And that is exactly why you will" she retorted.  "I didn't tell you to find
another to share your love with!  Sex is a physcial act, a thing of
pleasure.  It is made something more by your love, but it is not in itself
an act of love.  Heavens, girl, you are sometimes still so naive!  Children
are important, they are our legacy.  You would be seriously remiss to limit
your genetic influence to children by only one father" she scolded.
"But" I cried desperately, "I don't want to raise someone else's child!  I
don't want to birth children who aren't wanted!"
Grandmother's expression softened slightly, though her tone did not.
"If that is all that is so worrisome to you, then we will simply foster the
child to other relations who have not been so fortunate.  He will be raised
by a family that wants and loves him."
I buried my face in my hands, not wanting to face this.  "But...Brand.  How
will I explain to him?  He is not of Darkover, he won't..." I faltered.
I sensed rather than saw her shaking her head.  "Child, you have so far
still to go.  Have you learned nothing?  Did I teach you such utter nonsense
and lack of confidence in yourself?"  She sighed heavily.  "Do you truly
think your <i>beloved</i> so shallow, that he would love you less if another
touched you?  Do you think he is so selfish to begrudge you pleasure or
happiness?  You are closely related and your pairing has not been overly
fertile.  Do you think he would hate you for giving him another child by a
different sire?"
My head snapped up, fury in my eyes.  "No, of course not!  We..."  I
stopped, confused, my thoughts racing.
"Then perhaps you are ashamed to share pleasure?  Do you fear that you will
enjoy it?  Will it lessen your pleasure with Brand if you do?  Are you
afraid that he too will find another?  Do you think he'll not return to you?"
"I..." I stammered, my face flushed with anger and confusion.  A memory of
Fiona's attentions came to mind, flustering me further.
"Does this embarrass you Celeste?  Can you not discuss this?" Grandmother's
voice was harsh and cutting.  "Does Brand <i>own</i> you?"
It was a calculated remark designed to strike home and it did.
"No" I said angrily.
"Will you ever go to Amber again, girl?  Will you ever attend any social
functions there?  Or will you avoid those relations the rest of your life?
Will you cleverly dodge every statemen who courts your affections, every
courtier who makes a friendly advance?  Political alliances are often forged
between the sheets, and stop looking so shocked Celeste.  There are
advantages to accepting a political marriage or a contract for producing
heirs with a short-lived shadow dweller.  What would you say to avoid such
a thing?  Will you tell your father and grandfather that you can't, you're
already married?  Will you introduce your beloved lifemate to them?"
I was speechless.  I stared at her in misery.
"And what of those who would use your naive loyalty to injure one or both of
you?  You would be a wonderful tool to destroy Brand or lure him into
entrapment.  How could he not fall for such a ploy, knowing that all they
had to do was rape you to destroy you, that such a simple act would be so
devestatingly destructive to your delicate emotional state?" Grandmother's
words fairly dripped with sarcasm.  "Since you cannot seperate your love
from a physical act, don't you think you'd broadcast your torment like a
beacon?  And if something should happen to him, then will you spend the rest
of your life alone?  Unable to experience even pleasure?"
I started to cry then and almost didn't feel her come to me for comfort.
"Chiya, you need to learn to understand the seperation of physical pleasure
from the emotional and spiritual linking you share in your love.  Don't you
see?  Only then can you be free to love without fear."
Crying softly, I nodded slowly.  I did understand, and I realized that I
never had before.
Softly, she added "And Fiona will be able to hurt you so much less."
I looked up in horror, not having been aware how much that she knew about
that before today.  She patted my hand gently, dismissing the revelation as
if it were nothing.
"I will speak to Brand.  For now though, it is enough that you understand
this.  You should consider how you want to deal with this chiya.  We will
speak again later."
                                                                                    
I realized dimly that I was dismissed, and went to spend some time in the
aviay alone.  It was a place of gentle relaxation and quiet meditation for
me. Brand, noting my love of sunlight and songbirds, had made a gift to me
of a number of small, animated creations.  They looked and sounded like
birds, and colored the leaves and branches of the aviary gracefully, though
they were but odd creations of mechanics and sorcery.  Grandmother tolerated
them as a quaint artistic oddity.  I watched them flutter about, singing
sweetly as I thought of Grandmother's words.
Later that day I went to find Faythe.  She was, as I suspected, down on
Darkover taking care of her horse.  I found her merrily chatting with a
young stable hand who occasionally worked there.   I thought about
Clarissa's views, and looking at Faythe I felt a little ill.  Collecting her
up quickly, we returned home for dinnertime.  Grandmother made no mention of
it again for some time.
Over the next few months, I thought again and again about that discussion.
Grandmother's words sank in, albeit slowly.  Often, when taking Faythe down
to Darkover or when picking her up again, I would find my thoughts straying
to the men working the fields, or driving their carts along the roads.  What
sort would she pick for me? I wondered.  Would I have a choice?  I would
sometimes watch them bending over their work, wondering if there was one of
them I could manage not to hate.
Finally, Faythe managed the transition on her own.  She had been trying for
some time, and was so very proud of her accomplishment.  I let her do down h
herself, following along to be safe.  She wanted to go riding, and having no
great urgency at home I went along as she wished.  A few of the women from
the stable-house accompanied us, as they always insisted it not proper for
us to go alone.  They kept their discrete distance, only riding in earshot
when spoken to.  We rode up into the hills so she could search for
wildflowers as was her whim.
We passed a small group of riders, weighed down as if on a long journey.
Faythe offered a merry if still proper greeting, which was politely
returned.  One of the men towards the back of the group gazed at me rather
intently, as if he was trying to put a face to a memory.  I smiled back
politely, but was startled to find myself wondering how distasteful it would
be to take him to my bed.  He was a rather striking man with red-gold hair
like mine and an intelligent air about him, and I found the thought vaguely
intriguing.  Disturbed, I cut the chance meeting short and ushered Faythe
along.  A few of the women cast me side-long glances, but I ignored their
implications.
That evening, after I saw Faythe home, I spent some time alone, just
thinking and enjoying the feeling of the cold and biting wind on my face.
As time passed, I began looking at Darkover, finally, with a different eye.
I observed the men of different areas and backgrounds, noting differences in
traits and appearences, and eventually I began wondering about whether or
not Clarissa selected them based on their genetic stock.  I sometimes found
myself appraising them for favorable traits I would like them to convey.  I
suppose this was a form of mental rebellion, some defense mechanism kicking
in to dehumanize them against what I would be required to do.  Grandmother
would shortly straighten this out, but for a time it seemed as if this were
the only way I looked at the natives of Darkover.
 
A few months passed, most of which I spent in my studies.  Brand had been
gone somewhere out in shadow, though he finally returned for a bit.  I
noticed Clarissa occasionally asking him to help with with small things,
obviously an excuse to talk, but there was nothing involving me as far as I
could tell.  Faythe, enamoured with being able to go take care of her
animals on her own, came and begged him to go riding with her.  At least on
one other occasion, we all went down to go riding, though I left them and
returned home early to get some rest when it became clear they were rapidly
deciding to turn it into a hunting expedition.  I begged out feigning
fatigue as I was just not interested in the activity.  I doubt Brand was
fooled, but as I did so many times, he just let it go.
On my way to my aviary to relax for a moment, I passed Grandmother sitting
by the fireplace in the Lower Hall.  Her needle point was resting in her lap
much too casually, and I got the impression she was waiting.  A little too
tired to cope, I smiled as I tried to go on by.  She put her work down and
patted a chair near her.
"Come child, you look troubled, sit down here with me."
"Domna, thank you, but I was just going to rest a bit, perhaps in the aviary."
"Then rest here with me instead" she smiled.  "We can talk."  It became
obvious there was no dodging this time, so I sat down with a sigh.  For a
few minutes, we stayed in silence.  I noticed the hall was completely
deserted and the quiet was deep and penetrating.  Then she spoke.
"I've noticed your attitude has improved a bit chiya.  The natives are not
so distasteful to you now, yes?"
I stared at my feet.  "They have their uses, I am sure."
"But they have lives too child.  They are not there solely for your use,
your selection.  I do not want you to see them as less than people either."
I nodded slowly, realizing that was just what I had been doing.
"It is about time for you to deal more closely with them, but I must tell
you where to go and what you will do there.  This is the fun part, I believe
you will find some humor in it."
Unhappily, then with growing amazement and amusement, I listened as she
explained the Dry Towners to me.  I had known of them and their enslaved
women, of course, but not in the detail she gave me now.  Their treatment of
women was a study in primitive sociology in a place like Darkover.  She
explained how she sent her daughters into their region, daughters who so
exactly resembled their ideal of the perfect slave, to 'capture' men for
stud without seriously disrupting their lifestyles or injuring their pride.
It was so like Clarissa to turn the tables on those arrogant males so
cleverly, but the picture painted of them felt inadaquate to me.  I felt I
needed to question their value in the breeding pool if they were so
backwards and her look was approving.
"A good thought Celeste dear, but they have a strong and useful genetic pool
from which we can produce good children.  They can be raised and trained in
a proper environment and brought to their full potential.  Only leaving
children there in that social cesspool would be criminal, not interbreeding
with decent stock."
"You must realize" she continued, "we do not want to disrupt the entire
culture here by our actions.  They are people, they do have lives.  But,
unlike most of the humans in this place, these Dry Towners have the
redeeming feature of looking at breeding much as I do, as a schedule of
genetic improvement.  So, instead of reinforcing inbred and undesireable
traits due to matches created for an emotional basis or for reasons of
state, they have a stronger genetic pool to work with.  Their breeding tends
to bring out the better, stronger characteristics.  In that they may be a
superior strain.  And we only want to choose from the best, but with a
minimal intrusion."
And I did understand, finally.  She sent me off to prepare for my 'hunt'.  A
short while after I'd gone upstairs I heard a commotion in the lower hall
that could only be Brand and Faythe returning.  I paused, listening, but no
familiar presence approached, no voices were raised in greeting.  I could
only assume that Grandmother had ambused them on the way in to give me time
alone.  I was grateful, I needed it.  Servants brought my dinner to my rooms
and I was left to eat in peace, staring out the window contemplatively.
Later that evening Brand came to me.  My glad though worried greeting died
on my lips.  I looked at the expression on his face and I knew Clarissa had
spoken to him.  It was written quite clearly in his eyes.  I realized I was
nervous of what his reaction would be.  His step as he entered the room was
soft so I knew he was not angry but I still could not meet his eyes again.
Shaking, I sat down on the edge of the bed.  Gently he came over and drew me
close beside him.
"Celeste" he said softly, turning my face to his, "look at me.  Such
terribly wrong notions you have.  No one will ever love you as I do and I am
so sure of your love for me.  Nothing can lessen this!"
I looked into his eyes, seeing the belief and sincerety there, hoping it was
genuine but still afraid.  He shook his head lightly.
"No child you bear will ever go unwanted, no matter who the sire may be.
Your children are part of you love, I will love them all the more because of
that.  How could I not?  If they're of your blood, they're already of mine
as well, aren't they?  You have been a wonderful mother.  I have worried
that I could not give you that chance again.  I am glad for you to accept a
new way to bring us more children.  I want you to be happy.  If
you want this, then I want it for you.  Clarissa said you were disheartened
after we tried for so long and failed.  Of course I don't mind!  How could
you think I'd love you less?"
I was amazed at Grandmother's subtle wordsmithing, but so relieved that he
could accept this.  Exhaustion struck me down, and happy though I was I
cried myself to sleep on his shoulder.
Clarissa did not come up to the room that night, and neither did Faythe.  I
suspected Clarissa had taken care of her for the evening, for which I was
grateful, leaving us some time to be alone.  Gentle nights such as that one
now live only in my memory, making it so much harder now to accept that
they're gone.
 
The next morning Faythe was bright and eager to spend time showing us 'her
latest project.'  Brand seemed in good spirits, as always around Faythe.
Bemused, we accompanied her to Darkover, to be surprised at her leading us
out into farmlands she had been working in.  The unveiling of her work was
impressive and she had made a number of improvements.  It was amazing to see
the way the plants and crops were florishing under her care.  The women
there clearly loved her though they held her almost in awe.  She had done a
great deal of work, making their upcoming harvest likely to be a tremendous
success.  Brand was very proud of her and she glowed with his praise.
We spent the day touring the farmlands and fields, Faythe an enthusiastic
and knowledgeable guide.  Finally we returned home for the evening meal,
Faythe anxious to share the day with Clarissa as well.
After dinner, Brand surprised me by taking the burden of explanation off my
hands.  While Clarissa looked on approvingly, he announced it was my turn
for a vacation.  Faythe beamed happily at him when he bragged that he got
her all to himself for a while.
"Daddy, you're going to stay here with me while Mommy's gone?"
"Yes" he smiled at her, "I'll stay in mommy's...I mean in our rooms for a
while.  There's lots of things I'd like to show you while Mommy takes a
vacation."  Faythe was utterly delighted, and I was immensely relieved.
 
The next morning I was sent to the Free Amazon's Guildhouse.  They were well
versed, and superbly trained.  As a Comyn woman, they would serve as a
proper escort.  Preparations were mostly done and our departure towards the
Dry Towns was quickly underway.  They explained to me the final details of
the endeavor, apparently being old hands at this sort of thing.
Grandmother had explained that for this to succeed, I would have to be
'captured' by a Dry Town slaver.  Nothing else would seem worth their
effort.  I had to admit the prospect was frightening but also a bit
exciting.  My adventure was soon underway.
As had been arranged we ran afoul of Dry Town slavers.  In a brief struggle
I was taken captive, bound, and stolen off to a Dry Town village.  I
couldn't help but wonder as I was carried off if I were being watched.  I
suspected Clarissa may be keeping an eye on me, but I wondered if perhaps
she'd allowed Brand to watch as well.
Over the next few weeks, I played my part well as I had been taught.  My
captor's name was Kerlac.  He was a rough and vaguely crude man, as I
expected a common worker to be, but he was not cruel.  I was subjected only
infrequently to discipline, though I knew he wanted to make certain I had
been 'gentled' before risking taking me to his bed.  I was docile to his
demands, acting as though I were delighted to have been worth his effort to
capture.
Gamely, I fought for the right to be his 'first' woman, his best.  I made
sure I was worthy of higher consideration.  Weeks passed as my place became
established in the order, but eventually I was claimed as best.
Grandmother's training was exemplory, but I admit I chose to enjoy myself
for a bit before taking the time to make sure I was pregnant with the
expected child.
I did speak with Kerlac, selecting my words carefully and not revealing
anything innappropriate in my opinion, but I did make it clear to him that
eventually I must return home.  This he seemed to expect in some way.  He
was quite fond of me, and told me I was welcome to return and visit with him
whenever I wished.  He was very amused, laughing uproarously, at the thought
of his descendants someday sitting on the Comyn Throne.
My return was carefully orchestrated as well.  I was again 'captured' while
en route to a different Town where I was to visit another influential Dry
Towner.  As I was travelling under the hospitality and protection of my
host, Kerlac suffered great sorrow over my loss, one that was not under his
control to prevent.
In a small, odd way, I felt I would miss him, though I did not then nor do I
now love him.  He understood that as well.  Grandmother's wisdom never
ceases to amaze me.
When I returned, it was a great relief to see Brand waiting for me.  With
her usual perceptiveness, Clarissa had Faythe off with her.  I didn't
realize until that moment how much I had missed him.  He was both glad and
relieved to see me as well, but there was an air of tension about him that
was very familiar to me.  We spent the afternoon together, just being close,
but I knew he needed to go.  Reluctant though he seemed to be to leave me,
he was just as anxious and restless to get going.  He promised me he would
return before my due date at the latest.  He wanted to find Faythe and say
goodbye.  She seemed dissappointed, but she never gave him grief about his
comings and goings.  He stayed until late that night, sitting for a few
hours with me in the aviary.  We talked a bit, and I could tell he was
really trying for me, but he was so jittery that I told him finally he
should go.  The look of relief in his eyes was intermixed with sorrow and a
deep distress, heartbreaking in it's intensity, as he kissed me goodbye.  I
hoped someday he would find a way to master his internal conflict, even as I
knew he likely never would.
 
I soon decided that I could not foster away the child after all, to my
chagrin and Clarissa's knowing smile.  Faythe wanted to learn about
childbirth and midwifery, and we all felt it better that she have a
positive experience and so she was taught.  Brand did return, fully three
weeks before my due date with some small and inobtrusive gifts for all of
us.  He was much more in control again, for which I was grateful.
The whole family was present at Brandt's birth and again I found it to be no
great ordeal, though it was somewhat more difficult than with Faythe.  I was
indecisive over what his name was to be, but Brand suggested we name him
Brandt.  I think it was his way of being more part of the child, and of
letting me know he would be true to his words.  Either way, I couldn't agree
more, and the name was chosen.  Had he truly been Brand's son, I don't
believe Clarissa would have allowed it, but as things stood she made no
protest.
Brandt was a moody, intense child with secrets in the shadows of his
midnight blue eyes.  He was handsome in a rugged way, his hair shading to
the golden side of strawberry blond, with highlights of fire the color of my
own.  In build he strongly resembled Kerlac, muscular and compact.  Overall
he seemed to have inherited the best physical attributes from each of us,
and again I was impressed with Clarissa's foresight.
Faythe adored him, devoting herself to her younger brother with her usual
charm, and he came to accept this with a quiet deliberation.  He treated
most displays of affection in that manner of his, with an unswerving
attentiveness that could be almost somewhat frightening in it's intensity.
He was often given to great bursts of passion at times as well; very extreme
emotions that took him to great heights of joy, anger and depression.  He
was a complicated boy.
Brand said once, in a vaguely troubled tone, that he reminded him of another
child he'd once known, but refused to elaborate more on that.  I worried
sometimes about Brandt's deep concentration and intensity, present even when
he was so young.  He was like a candle that blazed brightly at both ends,
and I could tell that Brand had similar misgivings.
Brandt became a rather talented artist.  His work was, predictably, as broad
and deep as his expanse of emotional expression, but showed the signs of
true genius.  We encouraged his endeavors, which he seemed appreciative of
in his own way.  He could turn his hand at any artistic expression he
wished, but none ever held his interest very long.  It was if he had
something to express, but could never find the medium to express it in.  It
always felt as though we were never quite reaching him on some level.
Little did we realize then how correct those feelings and intuition were.
 
Faythe remained, as always, untouched by her brother's wildly moody nature
and showered honest affection on him.  I always hoped she would prove a good
influence on him, but it seemed sometimes to push him farther away from us.
He had a distant, unreachability about him that not even Faythe seemed to
penetrate.  Brandt never took it out on her, but he did not respond in kind
either.  At times he could be crazily attached to her, the two of them
inseperable, but just as suddenly he'd avoid her for days.  She always took
it in stride with her typical good grace.  Their relationship was as
comlicated as his temperment, and I think of all of us she knew him best.
He learned early, of course, that Brand was his father only in
name as we did not lie to out children, not that it would be easy to do so
in Darkover.  Curiously enough, this knowledge drove him to try to develop
the strongest relationship with Brand, and to seek more and more
extravagant ways to impress him and win the acceptance he could never quite
believe he had.  His earliest works of art, and some of his later
masterpieces as well, were made for Brand alone.  Two of them became some of
Brand's most treasured possessions, curiously enough.  The first was an oil
rendering of Faythe and I, done at the height of Brandt's painting craze.
It was quite good; Brand hung it in our bedroom as he could never keep it
anywhere else safely.  The other was a lovely hand-crafted rug that Brandt
wove for him.  This he took with him back to Amber on one of his frequent
trips.  Brandt was immensely pleased by this, and it was one of the few
times I felt they made a real connection.
 
Brand was true to his word and tried to be a good father to Brandt.  Brandt,
in turn, craved and solicited Brand's approval, but there was still
something always distant between them.  Though we both tried and tried, he
was, however, never willing to let us really be his friends.  I regret that
we must have failed him somehow, and only later would we become so accutely
aware of how completely he was lost to us.
Brand seemed to avoid Brandt's extreme states of emotional displays, and
though he never said so, I believed it put some sort of inpenetrable
emotional rift between them.  While Brandt was growing up, it always felt to
me as though Brand kept his visits much shorter.  It wasn't that he was
around less, but his comings and goings seemed much more exaggerated.
Much later I would realize that it made it that much harder on Brand when he
first learned of Brandt's death.  I knew that somewhere inside he hoped to
reconcile the stress in their relationship someday, but we couldn't know
then that there would never be enough time, for either of them.

Nice touch with the rug.
                                                                                    
I wonder which path you took with your pet dry-towner ... either way it
would have been a learning experinece (for you with Brand is a very equal
relationship, and with the Dry-Towner it would be very unequal) and would
shape how you relate to various people in inferior positions or superior
positions or the illusion (perpetraited by you) of either.  You don't need
to write it in, but do let me know.  It is a valuable insight into Celeste
that I would appreciate.
                                                                                    
You blunted the darkeness in Brandt nicely, the only thing I would add
would be on Faythe's attunement to his moods, whihc you didn't share.
Maybe a throw-away line about Faythe mentioning that it wouldn't be good to
disturb him now, or vice versa, her mentionining that it would be good for
you to go in and have a kind word for him, now that his mood had shifted.
                                                                                    
I'm glad yougot Brand's comings and goings in nicely, as well.
                                                                                    
Ahh ... on to the next.

Reply-To: dkap@haven.org
From: "A Page in the Life of ..." <dkap@haven.org>
 
-=> Here's the first draft of Innocence Lost, a short story in the middle of
-=> Brandt's life.  (Yes, that's Brandt, not Brendon now.  Read Legacy, it
-=> explains it)
 
I read it.  I TRY to keep things in order ... <grin>
 
-=> Innocence Lost
-=> Brandt's life was a study in unfinished business.  Ever did he try new
-=> ideas, new directions, only to abandon them in a sweeping, bottomless
-=> depression, or a sudden joyous rapture with someting new.
-=> I cannot count the number of paths my son voraciously pursued.  Time and
-=> again would he return to a different artistic endearvor, only to leave it
-=> unfinshed before achieving true mastery.  Joy and frustration, living with
-=> Brandt.
-=> He lent his hand, in turn, to farming once under Faythe's enthusiastic
-=> encouragement.  This was one of his shorter lived professions, once he
-=> announced he was dying of boredom.  He studied medicine and healing at one
-=> point in his life.  Herbalism was his passion at the age of 14, and he
-=> developed some decent skill before wandering away from that too.  He devoted
-=> himself for many years to training in a monestary, learning proficiency in
-=> the martial arts before he decided that it was not his calling.  He raised
-=> horses on a small farmstead, becoming a passable trainer until he sold them
-=> all off.  His interest in sorcery was flamboyant but brief under the
-=> tutalage and encouragement of Clarissa.  But if I disappointed her efforts
-=> to teach patience, Brandt exceeded me tenfold.
-=> Sled dogs I remember were his great passion for some years, until the
-=> monotony of responsibility finally wore on him.  In short, Brandt was more
-=> restless than even his adopted father, ever searching and seeking for the
-=> answers that eluded his grasp.
-=> When he was 38, I recall, he ran across his greatest and shortest career.
-=> It ended in near tragedy only days after it had began, and nearly cost him
-=> his life.  He announced his latest passion early one morning at breakfast,
-=> his eyes aglow with an inner fire that burned so brightly when he was in the
-=> grip of a new enthusiasm.  Funny, it always seemed to me at those times that
-=> he was, impossibly, so much like Brand.
-=> He came rushing to the table, ignoring the warning look of displeasure in
-=> Clarissa's eyes for his lack of any sort of decorum and earning a stifled
-=> giggle from Faythe.
-=> "Mother" he gasped breathlessly, skidding to a halt, "would you mind, I
-=> mean, may I be excused from breakfasting today?  I want to get down to the
-=> forests while the day is still dawning, it's the best time you know."
-=> No, I didn't know, I had no idea what he was going on about, but Clarissa's
-=> cool tone brought an immediate change to his bearing and body language,
-=> stopping his headlong rush in an instant.
-=> "And what, Brandt dear, is so important that could make you forget all sense
-=> of proper greeting and propriety at this hour?"
-=> He turned much more slowly, sinking into a chair with the wind knocked out
-=> of his sails.  Clarissa could do that to you, with a simple tone of voice.
-=> His face took on a much more respectful cast as he looked at her rather
-=> sheepishly.
-=> "Forgive me, Domna.  I wished to take advantage of the early hour and the
-=> fresh snow to begin tracking."  She looked at him impassively, then nodded,
-=> turning back to her coffee.  I however, was totally lost.
-=> "Tracking?" I asked blankly.  "Tracking what?"
-=> He grinned at me wryly.
-=> "I just finished some excellent books on hunting technique and the furrier
-=> trade.  It is, you know, a good season for furs Mother, so I thought to..."
-=> I waved a hand wearily, cutting him off, knowing full well he could likely
-=> give me a long and involved dissertation.  I glanced at Grandmother for her
-=> nod of approval, which seemed to me almost as weary as my own reaction to
-=> Brandt's endless enthusiasm.  Her faint smile echoed my sentiments.
-=> "Go on Brandt, go" I told him.  "But, if you're going to be gone overly
-=> long, do be kind enough to send word at least so I don't worry."
-=> He grinned again, a quicksilver hint of amusement in his dark eyes.
-=> "As if you couldn't check in on me whenever you wanted to" he laughed, but
-=> caught my own expression and quickly ammended, "All right, all right,
-=> Mother, I promise."
-=> I received a quick kiss on the cheek, hurried though never disrespectful, as
-=> did Clarissa.  A quick grin and wink for Faythe and he was off.  Such was
-=> Brandt.
                                                                                    
THen he russhed off, throwing decorum to the winds, then followed a sigh
from Clarissa.
 
-=> The next two days passed uneventfully, as we all had our studies to attend
-=> to.  Clarissa was tutoring Faythe with some obscure and advanced methods of
-=> preparing herb ointments and tinctures from her various gardens and crops,
-=> and I was studying finer points of trump artistry with Darkstar during one
-=> of his infrequent visits.  I confess Brandt and his activities were far from
-=> my mind as I tumbled into bed mentally exhausted that second night.
-=> It was early in the dark hours of the morning, long my children's favorite
-=> time for emergencies, when I awakened from a dream covered in a sheen of
-=> sweat.  I had dreamed of Faythe, warning me that Brandt was in danger,
-=> serious trouble, and I came fully alert at once.  Pulling a robe about me I
-=> opened my door to see Faythe coming down the hall, Clarissa in tow.
-=> Faythe's eyes were wide in terror, and if not for the reassuring presence
-=> firmly steadying her, I felt at once she would be in tears.
-=> Quickly we moved to the Tower, where Grandmother found him at once in the
-=> Crystal.  The scene was at first confusing but clarified itself almost
-=> immediately.
 
Faythe would have gone to you first, and then gone to disturb Clarissa.
She wouldn't have needed the Crystal (her home and all) and would have just
cast it (at Faythes instistance of urgency) in front of y'all.
 
-=> Brandt stood in a fighting stance backed in front of a low cave in a jumble
-=> of rocks, his weapon drawn and blooded, his own blood running freely into
-=> his eyes from a nasty cut above his brow.  There was a wicked slash across
-=> his chest, and he balanced carefully on his left leg, the right thigh
-=> sporting an embedded dagger.  His breathing was harsh but steady, though he
-=> looked slightly dazed.
-=> Slightly behind him on the ground was a silver-white wolf bitch, blood
-=> smeared over half her coat.  She shivered and struggled to move, but she was
-=> badly wounded as well with a cut deep across her ribs.  One leg was mangled
-=> likely beyond repair, bone fragments jutting through the fur and gleaming
-=> wetly with blood in the moonlight.  Nosing and cowering behind her was a
-=> litter of pups, crying softly.
-=> All this we took in in but an instant and then Brandt's attackers were
-=> apparent.  There were six of them, but only four stood to oppose him at the
-=> moment.  One writhed on the ground in pain, apparently bleeding to death.
-=> The last lay unmoving in a puddle of blood and gore, his face messily
-=> destroyed by a solid strike.
-=> Of the other four, one bore wounds as bad as Brandt's, but all were armed
-=> nastily.  It was immediately clear what the outcome would be.  Brandt was
-=> out of time.  Faythe gave one small choking sob, and then we acted.
-=> *****
 
Ahh ... now to take in my role as a GM.  Faythe would have sat down quickly
on the floor and pressed her hand to her side, the wolf would have healed
itself, and added it's weight to the fight.  Well, actually it would be
Faythe moving the wolf's body, burning up the last little bit of it's
essense of life, and some of Faythe's, so it could give it's life for it's
pups.
 
Darkstar, at the same time (he was, of course, on the scene almost
immediately at the commotion) would have shifted suddenly into the likeness
of Brandt, and dissapeared in a rainbow burst, and you would have seen a
second, larger and more muscled (male?) wolf bounding out of a rainbow
shimmer just over Brandt's shoulder.
 
You would have immediately began preperations to transfer down (it does
take some time, basically it was the equivelant of opening up a shadow
gate, but somewhat more complex, and normally has riders on it that one
cannot do it when others can observe, except in special circumstance) when
you found your power drained, adn Clarissa using you somewhat as a battery
to push the two of you down there faster, and creating the conditions under
which one can appear even if observed.
 
Let's see Brandt takes on the much wounded one, of the able ones, a wolf a
piece would be their match, leaving the one who was circling Brandt (and
hadn't apparently noticed either of the two wolves in his concentration) to
you, for you knew that Clarissa was going to need to catch her breath after
such an expenditure.  I expect the old crunch and squeek would slow him
down.
 
Then Clarissa would transfer you, Brandt, Darkstar, and the wolves back up,
and after a few moments, would follow.
 
You would have to tend to Brandt and Faythe, who seems to have gotten a
nasty slash to her ribs from somewhere, and a somewhat recked ankle
... <grin> The She Wolf would expire quite quickly, after a poinient glance
at her pups and at Brandt.
                                                                                    
-=> *****
-=> Brandt lie in a state of near shock, his voice dead with fatigue as he told
-=> me the story.  It seemed he'd been following wolf tracks for over a day,
-=> trying to make out the animal's territory and place his traps in logical
-=> configurations as the books had taught him.  Persistance paid off, and he
-=> finally trailed the wolf near to her den, but he was too late.
-=> Another trapper had staked the area, and the bitch had been caught in a leg
-=> trap.  Not the kind he was using, he felt them too cruel, but etiquette
-=> demanded you leave another trapper's lines alone.  Frustrated over losing a
-=> day and a half of work, he angrily turned to go when he first heard her.
-=> Whining softly, and heartbreakingly he said, she let out a low moaning sound
-=> that was nearly human.  Uneasy, he turned back to look at her again, and was
-=> horrified to see several little pups creeping out of the brush to nuzzle
-=> their dying mother.  She was trying to wash and nurse them, in all her pain,
-=> and they were crying pitifully.
-=> Brandt watched for a moment, heartsick, until he could stand it no more.  He
-=> said he knew, right at that moment, he could never be a trapper.  He had
-=> never contemplated that aspect of what he was doing and it horrified him.
-=> Mustering all his control and his not inconsiderable skill with animals, he
-=> slowly worked his way to the wolf, carefully trying to calm her.  She
-=> watched him with frightened but intelligent eyes, and did not try to attack.
-=> As gently as he could, he worked her leg free of the trap.  Trembling, she
-=> lifted her head and licked his hand, once.
-=> Ever so softly, he picked her up and followed the pups blatent trail to
-=> their den, they tripped and gamely struggled to keep up by his feet.
-=> Working with what he could find on hand, he managed to start to care for her
-=> wounds.  He was giving her a bit of water and dried beef when he heard
-=> footsteps behind him.
-=> Turning, he found the party of six men approaching, a group of trappers that
-=> worked these mountains.  They were grim and unsmiling, making their
-=> intentions known with drawn steel.  Brandt was unsure, he'd trespassed on
-=> their stake, interfered with one of their traps, and knew he was in the
-=> wrong, but, he told me, he was so heartsick over those pups.
-=> One of the men offered him an easy grin, told him there wasn't no reason why
-=> this couldn't be worked out.
-=> "After all" he said, "you got our wolf right there, s'not like you stole her
-=> away or nothin.  Sides, you did us a time saving fer sure ferritin out that
-=> den fer us, didna have ta go backtrackin our own selves on the morrow."
-=> Brandt stood uneasily, not sure yet how to procede.
-=> "Jest to show we all kin be reasonable men" and here he exchanged nods with
-=> one of his companions, "thar's not a lot ta be done with the pups, so's
-=> we'll let ya fur, say, two of em, jest as a thanks for taking care of the
-=> trackin.  That sit right with you boy?"
-=> The man offered another easy grin, Brandt told me, figuring he'd made a
-=> generous offer.  In another time or place, he said, he guessed it was fairly
-=> generous of them not to just demand he get lost.  But the very thought of
-=> those helpless puppies being killed and skinned.
-=> "I don't know, Mother, I just saw red" he finished helplessly.
-=> The infamous inherited temper flared, and he drew steel with his teeth bared.
-=> "I guess you'll be killing these wolves over my dead body" he replied tightly.
-=> The man spat into the snow, unconcerned, and told him "Guess we will at that."
-=> All pretense of parlay was abandoned, and the fight was on.  Sometime during
-=> the fight, he said, one of those barbarians nailed the wolf, accidently he
-=> figured, which was how her side got so cut up.  He figured he was pretty
-=> well finished when we showed up.  He was a little abashed at almost dying
-=> defending an animal, but then he started crying.
-=> He told me, in tears, that he couldn't just let them kill her.
-=> "She <i>trusted</i> me, she let me help her when it was men who'd almost
-=> killed her.  I just...couldn't...betray that.  It seemed...so..." he
-=> faltered, having no words for what he was trying to express.
-=> "Shh" I told him, "you don't have to justify what you did.  I'm proud of you
-=> for standing up for something you believed in."
-=> He lay back more peacefully, looking at me gratefully for understanding.  I
-=> didn't, not fully, but it seemed so important to him for me to accept and
-=> comprehend this.
-=> Faythe threw her arms around him, crying, telling him how much she loved him
-=> and that he couldn't have done a more noble thing.  He looked pleased, but
-=> embarrassed.  I left them to talk, feeling that I'd just seen a side of my
-=> son I hadn't even known.
 
He would have thrown his arms around her in thanks.  And then insisted on
tending her wounds himself.
 
-=> They tried their best, the two of them, but they just couldn't save that
-=> wolf.  She was in too bad a shape, and she'd been wounded too long before
-=> Brandt found her.  Faythe cried all night when she died, but Brandt got very
-=> determined and silent.
 
Instead, they probably had a quiet ceremony for her, somewhat reminicent of
your funeral.  Darkstar attends (as was appropriate) in the shape of the
large wolf.  It was in her cave.  You noticed that the trappers were still
where they had fallen, but all the wounds looked like they were inflicted
by wolves, as opposed to any human intervention.  At your glance Clarissa
would have tossed off a line to the effect of they would be found soon
enough.  Brandt might have wanted to burry them too, but Clarissa or
yourself (more probably you) would have talked him out of it.  They had to
be found without human intervention, at least that is what Clarissa had
gone out of her way to provide.
 
-=> He insisted on taking care of those pups, he said
-=> he'd made a committment to their mother and now he owed it to her.  I let
-=> him go and do what he thought he needed to do.  Faythe, of course, helped him.
-=> They raised them and let them go free, all but one.  Brandt kept one of
-=> them, though he let him run free a lot of the time.  He was unbelieveably
-=> attached to that pup, and I always wondered what it symbolized for him.  He
-=> kept company with that wolf till the day it died, at a healthy old age, and
-=> he mourned him like a brother lost.  It's probably the only thing in his
-=> entire life he saw from beginning to end, and never abandoned in the middle.
-=> I guess that's where he got his love in later life for sled dogs, though he
-=> never compared them himself.  He seemed to think caring for that wolf paid
-=> his debt to it's mother, and maybe he was right.
-=> Perhaps this is how I best remember him.
 
This incident would lead to Faythe pestering (in her own quiet, irresistable
way) Darkstar, every time he showed up, to teach her to shift.  He might
even eventually give in.  When pressed, Faythe would admit to you and
Clarissa that the transfer thing was something that Brand had taught her.
You weren't able to learn it from her, or Brand if you had thought to try.
 
Hmm ... On to the next.

All right ... Here one "Awriteh, padnu, les shaddle up and ride fro that
there sunset."
                                                                                    
Oh, you ment on the draft?  Ok.
                                                                                    
-=> Shame
-=> I still wish it hadn't been Faythe who found him, but we cannot change what
-=> has been.  If only we could.
-=> We all knew something was horribly wrong, we always knew with Brandt, at
-=> least Faythe did.  And it was she who got to him first, so it was in
-=> Faythe's arms that he died, as it was in Faythe's hands he was born.
                                                                                    
YOu werent' sure he wasn't dead already by the time Faythe got there, for
you feel she would proabably have tried to take on at least some if not all
of his wounds (she would rather have died than let him die, but she is
indeed practical, and rather they both lived)
                                                                                    
-=> She called me, of course, but I wasn't in time, to my eternal shame and
-=> regret.
                                                                                    
She called before she went there, as soon as she knew something was wrong.
Usually she is slower in transport than you are, due to lack of experience,
talent paths, and power levels.  This time she beat you there.  But still,
she was too late, and so were you.
                                                                                    
-=>  When I got there, she was holding him, rocking him back and forth
-=> like he was a baby again, and I realized he had taken his last breath.  His
-=> blood was smeared over both of them.  Faythe's grief was like a physical
-=> blow as I fell to my knees beside them.  He was so badly cut up it was hard
-=> to see where he wasn't wounded.  One of those dark, beautiful eyes was
-=> swollen forever shut and he was deathly pale.
-=> Faythe just held him, crying over and over, "No, no not Brandt, no", until I
-=> took them both in my arms and held them tightly.  I don't even know how much
-=> time passed that we sat there like that in our grief.  Finally I dimly
-=> realized that Grandmother was there, helping us up, helping us to take him
-=> away.  Faythe could hardly stand, so we leaned on each other while Clarissa
-=> carried Brandt.  Somehow we made it back home.
 
You had to make it somewhere secluded first, it was in a busy place.
Clarissa would probably hesitate to show her face there, for divine
intervention would requre him to stand up and have his wounds magically
healed, and even she could not give life to the once living.
 
-=> I suppose in some way I blame myself.  I should have made more time for him,
-=> should have paid more attention to his comings and goings, to his troubles.
-=> But none of that can help now.  He's gone from me, murdered and taken away
-=> as surely as Brand was, and Faythe and I are left to go on without them.
-=> I think, in her own way, she grieved as strongly for her brother as I did
-=> for Brand.  Faythe has no bounds to capacity to love, no limits, and in a
-=> way I believe she is the stronger of the two of us.  Certainly she held
-=> together better than I.
 
And together, as sword sisters, you would have gone off, at your
insistance, to revenge him.  To discover, step by step, how this came to
be, to find those who stole away the flesh of your flesh from you.  Like
Bleys, from your mother, your child was taken away, never to be returned.
Let's just say you went a bit off your nut over this one.  Faythe was never
far from your side (her doing, but you gained much comfort from it) until
it was over.  Clarissa was somewhat hesitant about allowing you to go, but
that was only in retrospect.  Brand was there when you got back, after
closure, but not before.  This one can become a novel if you let it.  Many
little chapters.  Perhaps a second web page?  The difficulties of revenging
a slain child, by a younger Celeste than the recent retrospectives.
Perhaps this is why you were writing the other pieces, for Clarissa
intimated that you would never be able to get over the experiences (at the
time, refering to the actions you took in the wake of Brandt's death),
untill you had written them.  This "second" page was written during your
tutelage, as opposed to the rest of the "first" page which was written
during pattern-fall.
                                                                                    
Be well.
 
On to the next.

You might want to mention it in passing earlier, that way the groundwork is

-=> Is this what you were looking for, or did you want something more indepth?
 
Ahh ... you took a third path.  The path of compassion.  Instead of being
subservient to him, or breaking him to your will ... you instead befreinded
him.  Yes, that was the type of information I was looking for.
 
Thank you.

Hmm ... did you take the fourth out with your hands, or with a tool?  You
didn't have any sorcerous engergy to hand (Clarissa sapped yours) for the
semi implied sorcerous dealings.  If by hand (which you are more than
capable of, something about an enraged mother defending her cubs, not to
mention your points in it. (Don't forget to email me a copy of your final
character.)
                                                                                    
The reminicence to your own funeral would not be tossed off so lightly.
Remember all that raw emotion from them caring about you, even when you
hadn't known it.  You might be motivated to say or do something, to sort of
give back to the wolf some of the dignaty that your death was given.
                                                                                    
Darkstar, as teh wolf probably howled long and hard, adn the rest of the
pack might have come by to pay their respects.  Hey, it might be good
theater (writing, whatever) for them to carefully ignore the dead bodies of
the humans or the like.  You know wolves much better than I do, so what
ever would be appropriate pack behaviour ...
                                                                                    
Hmm ... I don't  know if you would know  if Darkstar agreed.  Let me think
on that one for a while ...  Unless you want to make it into part of one
of your stories, of course ... then I couldn't stand in the way of great
art.
                                                                                    
One of the reasons she was so reluctant to tell you about what she did, is
because she used up the wolf to protect her brother ... it is one of the
reasons she was so understanding about him almost dying to defend something
important to him.
                                                                                    
Oh ... and somehow you could never bring yourself to ask Brand about
Faythe's ability of transferal.

Innocence Lost - Second Draft (rewrite)
 
Brandt's life was a study in unfinished business.  Ever did he try new
ideas, new directions, only to abandon them in a sweeping, bottomless
depression, or a sudden joyous rapture with someting new.
I cannot count the number of paths my son voraciously pursued.  Time and
again would he return to a different artistic endearvor, only to leave it
unfinshed before achieving true mastery.  Joy and frustration, living with
Brandt.
He lent his hand, in turn, to farming once under Faythe's enthusiastic
encouragement.  This was one of his shorter lived professions, once he
announced he was dying of boredom.  He studied medicine and healing at one
point in his life.  Herbalism was his passion at the age of 14, and he
developed some decent skill before wandering away from that too.  He
devoted himself for many years to training in a monestary, learning
proficiency in the martial arts before he decided that it was not his
calling.  He raised horses on a small farmstead, becoming a passable
trainer until he sold them all off.  His interest in sorcery was flamboyant
but brief under the tutalage and encouragement of Clarissa.  But if I
disappointed her efforts to teach patience, Brandt exceeded me tenfold.
Sled dogs I remember were his great passion for some years, until the
monotony of responsibility finally wore on him.  In short, Brandt was more
restless than even his adopted father, ever searching and seeking for the
answers that eluded his grasp.
When he was 38, I recall, he ran across his greatest and shortest career.
It ended in near tragedy only days after it had began, and nearly cost him
his life.  He announced his latest passion early one morning at breakfast,
his eyes aglow with an inner fire that burned so brightly when he was in
the grip of a new enthusiasm.  Funny, it always seemed to me at those times
that he was, impossibly, so much like Brand.
He came rushing to the table, ignoring the warning look of displeasure in
Clarissa's eyes for his lack of any sort of decorum and earning a stifled
giggle from Faythe.
"Mother" he gasped breathlessly, skidding to a halt, "would you mind, I
mean, may I be excused from breakfasting today?  I want to get down to the
forests while the day is still dawning, it's the best time you know."
No, I didn't know, I had no idea what he was going on about, but Clarissa's
cool tone brought an immediate change to his bearing and body language,
stopping his headlong rush in an instant.
"And what, Brandt dear, is so important that could make you forget all
sense of proper greeting and propriety at this hour?"
He turned much more slowly, sinking into a chair with the wind knocked out
of his sails.  Clarissa could do that to you, with a simple tone of voice.
His face took on a much more respectful cast as he looked at her rather
sheepishly.
"Forgive me, Domna.  I wished to take advantage of the early hour and the
fresh snow to begin tracking."  She looked at him impassively, then nodded,
turning back to her coffee.  I however, was totally lost.
"Tracking?" I asked blankly.  "Tracking what?"
He grinned at me wryly.
"I just finished some excellent books on hunting technique and the furrier
trade.  It is, you know, a good season for furs Mother, so I thought to..."
I waved a hand wearily, cutting him off, knowing full well he could likely
give me a long and involved dissertation.  I glanced at Grandmother for her
nod of approval, which seemed to me almost as weary as my own reaction to
Brandt's endless enthusiasm.  Her faint smile echoed my sentiments.
"Go on Brandt, go" I told him.  "But, if you're going to be gone overly
long, do be kind enough to send word at least so I don't worry."
He grinned again, a quicksilver hint of amusement in his dark eyes.
"As if you couldn't check in on me whenever you wanted to" he laughed, but
caught my own expression and quickly ammended, "All right, all right,
Mother, I promise."
I received a quick kiss on the cheek, hurried though never disrespectful,
as did Clarissa.  A quick grin and wink for Faythe and he rushed off again,
throwing the momentary decorum to the wind.  I heard Clarissa sigh.  Such
was Brandt.
The next two days passed uneventfully, as we all had our studies to attend
to.  Clarissa was tutoring Faythe with some obscure and advanced methods of
preparing herb ointments and tinctures from her various gardens and crops,
and I was studying finer points of trump artistry with Darkstar during one
of his infrequent visits.  I confess Brandt and his activities were far
from my mind as I tumbled into bed mentally exhausted that second night.
It was early in the dark hours of the morning, long my children's favorite
time for emergencies, when I awakened from a dream covered in a sheen of
sweat.  I had dreamed of Faythe, warning me that Brandt was in danger,
serious trouble, and I came fully alert at once.  Pulling a robe about me I
opened my door to see Faythe coming down the hall.  Her eyes were wide in
terror, and I realized at once she was be in tears.
Quickly we woke Clarissa.  At Faythe's terrified urgency, Clarissa brought
up an image of what was going on.  The scene was at first confusing but
clarified itself almost immediately.
Brandt stood in a fighting stance backed in front of a low cave in a jumble
of rocks, his weapon drawn and blooded, his own blood running freely into
his eyes from a nasty cut above his brow.  There was a wicked slash across
his chest, and he balanced carefully on his left leg, the right thigh
sporting an embedded dagger.  His breathing was harsh but steady, though he
looked slightly dazed.
Slightly behind him on the ground was a silver-white wolf bitch, blood
smeared over half her coat.  She shivered and struggled to move, but she
was badly wounded as well with a cut deep across her ribs.  One leg was
mangled likely beyond repair, bone fragments jutting through the fur and
gleaming wetly with blood in the moonlight.  Nosing and cowering behind her
was a litter of pups, crying softly.
All this we took in in but an instant and then Brandt's attackers were
apparent.  There were six of them, but only four stood to oppose him at the
moment.  One writhed on the ground in pain, apparently bleeding to death.
The last lay unmoving in a puddle of blood and gore, his face messily
destroyed by a solid strike.
Of the other four, one bore wounds as bad as Brandt's, but all were armed
nastily.  It was immediately clear what the outcome would be.  Brandt was
out of time.  Faythe gave one small choking sob, and then we acted.
 
Faythe dropped herself to the floor, pressing her hand tightly to her side.
 A faint sheen of perspiration glistened on her face and her eyes locked in
concentration.  The wolf at Brandt's feet, amazing, began to heal, and she
struggled to her own feet.  Darkstar blurred past my shoulder, having burst
into the commotion, shifting suddenly into the likeness of Brandt and
dissappearing in a rainbow burst.  A moment or so later I saw a second,
larger and more heavily muscled wolf bound of out of rainbow shimmer just
over Brandt's shoulder. The two wolves lept into the fray.  Brandt rounded
on the opponent he'd already injured.
All this occurred in the space of heartbeats as I immediately began
preperations to transfer down.  Suddenly I felt power drain from me to
Clarissa as she overrode the rules, using my energy to fuel pushing up
there quickly.
Arriving, I saw Brandt fighting with the same opponent, two of the others
grappling with snarling swirls of fur.  The last was circling Brandt,
looking for an opening.  So intent was he concentrating on that fight he
didn't seem to have even noticed the sudden surplus of wolves.  A single
rapid-fire glace at Clarissa told me she was catching her breath, as it
were, from the effort of that transfer.  Gathering what energy I had left,
I focused on the circling fighter, taking him quickly, if rather messily,
out of the battle.
In just moments, it was all over.  Clarissa gathered herself up and
transferred myself, Brandt, Darkstar and all the wolves back to the tower.
After a few moments, she followed as well.
I quickly went about the business of tending to Brandt's injuries, as well
as trying to get Faythe's bleeding under control.  She seemed to have
somehow gotten a nasty slash to her ribs and had somehow seriously wrecked
her ankle.  I remember pausing to look at her curiously, but held my
questions for later.  The wolf bitch lay on the bottom of Brandt's bed, at
his insistance, but her breathing was labored and painful.  She lifted her
head and gazed at him, at her pups tumbling confusedly about on the floor,
then back to Brandt again.  For a long moment, he held her gaze.  It seemed
almost as if some understanding passed between them, though perhaps it was
my overwraught imagination.  Then she lay her head down on her bloody paws,
closed her eyes, and sighed out her last breath.  Brandt watched her, his
own eyes full of tears.  Faythe reached out and sadly held his hand while I
continued to tend to their injuries.
 
Brandt lay in a state of near shock, his voice dead with fatigue as he told
me the story.  It seemed he'd been following wolf tracks for over a day,
trying to make out the animal's territory and place his traps in logical
configurations as the books had taught him.  Persistance paid off, and he
finally trailed the wolf near to her den, but he was too late.
Another trapper had staked the area, and the bitch had been caught in a leg
trap.  Not the kind he was using, he felt them too cruel, but etiquette
demanded you leave another trapper's lines alone.  Frustrated over losing a
day and a half of work, he angrily turned to go when he first heard her.
Whining softly, and heartbreakingly he said, she let out a low moaning
sound that was nearly human.  Uneasy, he turned back to look at her again,
and was horrified to see several little pups creeping out of the brush to
nuzzle their dying mother.  She was trying to wash and nurse them, in all
her pain, and they were crying pitifully.
Brandt watched for a moment, heartsick, until he could stand it no more.
He said he knew, right at that moment, he could never be a trapper.  He had
never contemplated that aspect of what he was doing and it horrified him.
Mustering all his control and his not inconsiderable skill with animals, he
slowly worked his way to the wolf, carefully trying to calm her.  She
watched him with frightened but intelligent eyes, and did not try to
attack.  As gently as he could, he worked her leg free of the trap.
Trembling, she lifted her head and licked his hand, once.
Ever so softly, he picked her up and followed the pups blatent trail to
their den, they tripped and gamely struggled to keep up by his feet.
Working with what he could find on hand, he managed to start to care for
her wounds.  He was giving her a bit of water and dried beef when he heard
footsteps behind him.
Turning, he found the party of six men approaching, a group of trappers
that worked these mountains.  They were grim and unsmiling, making their
intentions known with drawn steel.  Brandt was unsure, he'd trespassed on
their stake, interfered with one of their traps, and knew he was in the
wrong, but, he told me, he was so heartsick over those pups.
One of the men offered him an easy grin, told him there wasn't no reason
why this couldn't be worked out.
"After all" he said, "you got our wolf right there, s'not like you stole
her away or nothin.  Sides, you did us a time saving fer sure ferritin out
that den fer us, didna have ta go backtrackin our own selves on the
morrow."  Brandt stood uneasily, not sure yet how to procede.
"Jest to show we all kin be reasonable men" and here he exchanged nods with
one of his companions, "thar's not a lot ta be done with the pups, so's
we'll let ya fur, say, two of em, jest as a thanks for taking care of the
trackin.  That sit right with you boy?"
The man offered another easy grin, Brandt told me, figuring he'd made a
generous offer.  In another time or place, he said, he guessed it was
fairly generous of them not to just demand he get lost.  But the very
thought of those helpless puppies being killed and skinned.
"I don't know, Mother, I just saw red" he finished helplessly.
The infamous inherited temper flared, and he drew steel with his teeth bared.
"I guess you'll be killing these wolves over my dead body" he replied
tightly.
The man spat into the snow, unconcerned, and told him "Guess we will at that."
All pretense of parlay was abandoned, and the fight was on.  Sometime
during the fight, he said, one of those barbarians nailed the wolf,
accidently he figured, which was how her side got so cut up.  He figured he
was pretty well finished when we showed up.  He was a little abashed at
almost dying defending an animal, but then he started crying.
He told me, in tears, that he couldn't just let them kill her.
"She <i>trusted</i> me, she let me help her when it was men who'd almost
killed her.  I just...couldn't...betray that.  It seemed...so..." he
faltered, having no words for what he was trying to express.
"Shh" I told him, "you don't have to justify what you did.  I'm proud of
you for standing up for something you believed in."
He lay back more peacefully, looking at me gratefully for understanding.  I
didn't, not fully, but it seemed so important to him for me to accept and
comprehend this.
Faythe threw her arms around him, crying, telling him how much she loved
him and that he couldn't have done a more noble thing.  He looked pleased,
but embarrassed.  He returned her hug strongly, then told me the thought
he'd like to finish taking care of his sister himself.  He said it was
important to him.  I left them to talk, feeling that I'd just seen a side
of my son I hadn't even known.
Faythe cried silently when that she-wolf died, but Brandt got a very
determined air to him. He said he had to 'see it through'.
The two of them arranged a quiet ceremony for her, which was somewhat
reminicent to me of my own funeral.  Darkstar attended as well, in the form
of that same large wolf, which everyone seemed to think was appropriate.
They held the ceremony at her den.  I noticed when we arrived that the
trappers were still where they had fallen, but eerily it looked as thought
all the wounds they bore had been inflicted by wolves.  Not one had a mark
that could be attributed to sword or spell.  I glanced questions at
Grandmother, who shrugged it off.  She said they would be found soon
enough, and I understood what she'd done.
Brandt was uneasy and mentioned that perhaps it would be better if we
buried them, but I explained to him why we had to leave them as they were.
I knew, I told him, that they needed to be found without human
intervention, that Clarissa had made sure it would appear to be no more
than it seemed.  He understood, but I could see it had bothered him.  After
all, three of those men lie dead by his hand, and the other dead for his
sake.  It seemed to rattle him badly.
He insisted on taking care of those pups, he said he'd made a committment
to their mother and now he owed it to her.  I let him go and do what he
thought he needed to do.  Faythe, of course, helped him.
They raised them and let them go free, all but one.  Brandt kept one of
them, though he let him run free a lot of the time.  He was unbelieveably
attached to that pup, and I always wondered what it symbolized for him.  He
kept company with that wolf till the day it died, at a healthy old age, and
he mourned him like a brother lost.  It's probably the only thing in his
entire life he saw from beginning to end, and never abandoned in the
middle.  I guess that's where he got his love in later life for sled dogs,
though he never compared them himself.  He seemed to think caring for that
wolf paid his debt to it's mother, and maybe he was right.  Perhaps this is
how I best remember him.
 
This whole incident, of course, left unanswered questions and led to other
studies.  Faythe pestered, not that you could call her quiet, irrisistable
requests pestering, Darkstar whenever he showed up to teach her to shift.
He held out for a while, I'll give him that, but eventually he agreed.
Eventually everyone gives in to Faythe, at least once.
I asked her myself, and repeatedly, about where she had learned that
transference trick she used on that poor wolf.  Clarissa was curious as
well, and eventually Faythe gave in and admitted that Brand had taught it
to her.  She tried to show me how it was done, and I tried to learn, but I
never did quite get the knack of it.

-=> All the changes and updates have been finished and the final version of
-=> Legacy, with your notes on the relationship between Faythe and Brandt (her
-=> being sensitive to his moods and all) is up on the website.
                                                                                    
Ok, I'll check it there ...
                                                                                    
-=> Now, on to Revenge...
-=> Years of experience in the Agency just weren't going to be enough, I knew
-=> that already.  As much hate as I felt for him, I needed time.  Time to
-=> distance myself from emotional response, time to hone my skills to a
-=> psychotic razor's edge, time to practice.  And where better to get that
-=> practice than shadow?
                                                                                    
What about that time you went hunting with Faythe?  You might want to
reflect on that, and regret that she was not here to join you in this
hunt.  Speeking of which ... Did you tell her who killed her father?  If
so, did you tell her that the killer was family?
                                                                                    
-=> It took some effort to locate just the right shadow, with just the right
-=> combination of style where he still cast a reflections, but again years of
-=> study with Clarissa served me well.  Eventually I found one, a shadow in
-=> the right technological frame to allow my weapon of choice, and a shadow
-=> like enough to be a brother, like enough to provide a real challange.  And,
-=> as the famous man once said, the game was afoot.
-=>
-=> Weeks faded to months as I observed and watched.  My first task was to be
-=> certain, absolutely certain, it was a shadow, but a very close one.  I knew
-=> better than to start off by pursuing the real Amberite with no preparation.
-=>  And I knew the shadow, if carefully chosen, would be nearly as deadly as
-=> the real thing.
                                                                                    
With Caine, there was no way to tell for sure ... but you were pretty
positive.
 
-=> Setting myself up as an unnoticed shadow dweller in that place was no chore
-=> - I'd been so many people in so many places already.  It was the next stage
-=> that was so critical.  Information is the most valuable commodity in
-=> existance, a close sister to knowledge.  Never let anyone ever teach you
-=> differently.
 
Who were you?  WHat did you do?  Did you replace someone extant already?
Did you replace more than one person as you went about your information
gathering, slowly moving closer to your target as your information base
filled out?  Did you go about creating non-existant personalities (those
are harder, for so many pieces have to be forged, instead of peeling the
replacement with drugs and torture till you could be them, passibly enough)
to do whatever it was, or learn what ever you needed before you moved on?
How close, and in how many ways, each time, risking being discovered did
you get?  Did you find that he did not have his laundry done, but picked
random shops for new clothing?  Little things like that?
 
-=> Long weeks faded to months, and I watched.  I learned the man, his habits,
-=> his travels, his business, his sordid pleasures.  I watched, and I waited,
-=> and I buried hate deep within until I could smile in his face with nothing
-=> behind it.
 
How many times did you get close?  How many times, in the beginnign, did
you have to stop yourself from just striking out, no matter how desperate
the chance, no matter how far off the weapons would be?
 
-=> One cannot learn to stalk a prey unless one learns to first become the
-=> prey.  The foremost task to the true hunter is to know your target, as
-=> intimately as you know yourself or better.  You have to get inside their
-=> mind, get into their guts, know what makes them think what they think and
-=> why.  Learn what they see when the lights go out and know what wakes them
-=> in the dark.  Know why they will choose one place over another, no matter
-=> how similar, before they make the choice themselves.  Know them, in every
-=> waking moment of their lives.  When the gears click, when the connection
-=> becomes crystal clear, and you know what they're thinking, why they're
-=> worried, when they'll laugh and when they'll glance over their shoulder -
-=> only then does the true stalking begin.
 
How many times did you have to "rewright" that image in your head.  How
many times did you stand in waiting to where he should show up,
inconspicuously part of the flow of the events, that he didn't show, or
showed early or late.  Become real frustraited with his seeming complexity
or simplicity.
 
-=> Does that frighten you?  It should.  Would it frighten him.  I knew
better.
-=>  He was, as I said, a worthy challenge, difficult to read, more difficult
-=> to know.  But then, a Prince of Amber is no simple target, and of them all
-=> I was not about to underestimate Caine.
 
How many nights did youspend in frustrated agony, as one thing after
another fell apart.
 
-=> I had long ago decided the manner in which I would kill him, the weapon I
-=> had no choice but to use.  I knew it was not logic that drove this
-=> decision, but I knew just as certainly that I would be satisfied with no
-=> less.  I wanted the perfect angle, the perfect shot, the perfect kill.  Two
-=> arrows, one through the throat to silence that arrogant, hateful voice for
-=> all time, and one through the chest to end his miserable life.  Quick,
-=> vicious, deadly and oh, so very very sweet.
 
Fitting.  Somehow fitting.
 
-=> So, what do you think about the 'later' version of Celeste?  hehehehehehe
 
Sounds about right.  Needs smoe more angst in her past, to make her more
fixated now, though.  A little tuning will abrade the growing compassion
she is developing.

Umm ... no, the time that this was picked for was for a time that you were
going to spend a long period of time, dealing with people as people, for
you were getting to treat them as lower life forms again (fairly easy to
do, when you are that powerful), so you "finished your fostering", and was
sent home (say ~18-death) with occasional visits to your relatives
(Clarissa) and occasional visits from your siblings (Faythe, Brand,
Brant), but beyond that you are supposed to be simply a comyn woman for
that stretch of time.  Write in "marrage" to a Hastur for political
reasons, and, while it isn't great between you, your son Brandon is a good
study, and goes on to the council, making you proud in your "old age".  Not
until after your "death" do you come to him in a "vision" and tell him that
he is heir to a much greater heritage, and tell him how to age himself, and
how to "die" when appropriate (after all his loose ends are tied up)

Alton if you wish, I guess.  There might be a more appropriate family, but
I don't remember the family gifts off the top of my head.
 
Oh, The brain-dead one was from one of the last visits of Brand.  He didn't
know you had caught, mentioned that he would be unavailable and uninterupt-
able for some time (the reason he came to visit) for he was trying to take
care of something really dangerous (this was just before he planted himself
in the courts of Chaos, to sew the seeds, in cahoots with your Father and
your full Aunt) you didn't want him to go (hunch of yours) but knew he had
to fight his own battles, not owner ... etc.
 
When he leaves their company to set the false trail, he stops in, tells you
just a little longer and then everything will be all better, and maybe even
Faythe can go where she will.  Then get's introduced to his youngest
daughter.  She's instantly enamored with Brand, and when he leaves, vows to
follow him (on pure psyche).  She puree's her brains trying.  Poor
vegetable.
 
Oh, Brant and Faythe have a kid, Faythe has a second by a Dry-Towner (the
best of HIS generation, two generations after your best)  Brant has
fathered at least one other, in his various occupations.  Brant is not
really good at responsibility, he makes sure each of his kids (with the
exception of his and Faythe's) is fostered properly, and then lets that be
that.

Yeah ... good enough.  I guess.  If that's the way you want to play it.  I
figured it would be the transport one ... but, as I said, I need a list of
the families and their gifts through time before me to remember.
 
-=> >
-=> >-=>  sent for tower training when
-=> >-=> discovered/acknowledged/whatever.
-=> Ah, no.  This was part of the cover story, not to happen in history time.
-=> Memories altered, etc.  I was using that to explain why she wasn't around
-=> as a girl, wasn't arranged in marriage, etc.  When she comes into the story
-=> herself (to deal with people as people) that is her 'history' on Darkover,
-=> and why she was never 'around' before then.  Easier to have one tower full
-=> of people remember her then a whole dynasty, and all that.  She could be a
-=> vague recollection for others.  So then, that leaves her 'history' as born
-=> to a Lord of Alton, mother died in childbirth, fostered to Alton and sent
-=> off to the Tower for training.  She can come into the story, in actuality,
-=> at about, say, 19?
 
Sure 19 it is.  It was just that she WAS real.  The tower just forgot her
death, and remembered the accident as survivable (by you instead of her).
It really was an accident, caused by her trying something beyond her, not
something convieniently arranged by you or Grandma.  It also gets you a
chance to have lines to learn and a role to play for more than a short
time.
 
-=> Then get married off to a Hastur, for a good political arrangement between
-=> a lesser noble of Hastur and House Alton.  That leaves her with a decent,
-=> if not top of the line, blood lineage.  And, as someone who was
-=> Tower-trained, then she would make a valuable political marriage piece, for
-=> the desired laran breeding that Hastur would want.  Also, crossing Alton
-=> and Hastur, as I have come to understand it, would be desireable to both
-=> families as they are the opposed gifts that cannot be used in conjunction,
-=> making the cross-potential interesting.
 
Yes that crossbreeding would be interesting.  Your child will be very
powerful.
 
-=> >Umm ... no, the time that this was picked for was for a time that you were
-=> >going to spend a long period of time, dealing with people as people, for
-=> >you were getting to treat them as lower life forms again (fairly easy to
-=> >do, when you are that powerful), so you "finished your fostering", and was
-=> >sent home (say ~18-death) with occasional visits to your relatives
-=> >(Clarissa) and occasional visits from your siblings (Faythe, Brand,
-=> >Brant), but beyond that you are supposed to be simply a comyn woman for
-=> >that stretch of time.  Write in "marrage" to a Hastur for political
-=> >reasons, and, while it isn't great between you, your son Brandon is a good
-=> >study, and goes on to the council, making you proud in your "old age".  Not
-=> >until after your "death" do you come to him in a "vision" and tell him that
-=> >he is heir to a much greater heritage, and tell him how to age himself, and
-=> >how to "die" when appropriate (after all his loose ends are tied up)
-=>
-=> I have the death part arranged as follows:
-=> The Hastur Lord to whom she is married (I was going to set her as
-=> barrigana, but married is cool too) finally dies, the Dom Hastur is fairly
-=> new in place.  She would beg leave to visit her kinfolk in Alton and he
-=> would be all too happy to let her go.  Rehire the Thendara Free Amazons
-=> guild as a proper ladies escort, set off perhaps 2 weeks before the snows
-=> close the mountain passes, and get killed when attacked in the mountains by
-=> banshees or some such.  Have the 'remaining' Amazons carry what's left of
-=> her personal possessions, etc., on to Alton so no one will ever think to go
-=> looking for her.  After all, ripped apart by Banshees is pretty final.
-=> 'Fix' the memory of the attack in the minds of the Amazons so if any of the
-=> Alton's insist on probing for the truth of that matter, they will read that
-=> as true.
 
Nah ... you wouldn't be left to such a little protection, and the Amazons
would have lots of problems over this.  You simply would age yourself, and,
at the appropriate time, take the herbs and stasis spell you know would
slow your body functions enough to seem dead and to be honored for a long
and fruitful life.  You probably fostered some kids during your life, so
you would have the fond memories of a good funeral to compair with your
original funeral.  Clarissa would have insisted that this one be much less
of a trial for you.  It's funny, your family get's a reputation for seeming
to know when a member's life is going to end, for both you and your son's
effects and affairs were fairly nicely tied up and completed when you each
"died".  You probably died on Alton lands, though.

She ALWAYS was trying to catch.  Unless she was already pregnant.  This
time, it worked, though.  She didn't realize it until the morning after,
and went rushing to find him, to find that she was already too late, he had
left already.

-=> Oh, ick.  Perhaps....she could try to follow him via the matrix screens,
-=> doing the matter transferral trick that she was just beginning to learn
-=> from Faythe. She could have snuck up on her own and set it up, and fried
-=> her mind in the matrix, which would have instantly communicated itself to
-=> all of us.  Would that set her 'real' self loose, lost forever drifting in
-=> the matrix? or would that be too easy for Clarissa to fix?  Unless she did
-=> real and irreversible damage to her brain in the process, so that even if
-=> Clarissa could find her she would be unable to return to herself?  What do
-=> you think?
 
Nope, on sheer psyche.  She is bright enough to notice that he doesn't use
the screens to go where he goes.  For reasons that your character doesn't
know, she could NOT have fried herself on the matrix screens.
 
-=> >Oh, Brant and Faythe have a kid, Faythe has a second by a Dry-Towner (the

-=> Does Brandt and Faythe's kid live with all of us?  Does Faythe's second
-=> child live there or on Darkover?  I suppose Brandt's other kid is fostered
-=> somewhere he can make a difference?  What did you intend with that?  Do the
-=> PC's ever go to Darkover, by the way?
 
Faythe's children are not equipt to live in the overworld in their bodies.
They can visit by spirit-walking, but they cannot bring there bodies
there.  Various holding might have been established ... things might have
been done ... these don't have to be determined yet.
                                                                                    
Brant's other kid(s) were fostered to good homes, yes.  He never married
anyone (even Faythe) so they were not necessarily best matches (he is
guided by hormones, not breeding programs)  You know of one (or two) there
are more that you don't know about, and there are even one or two that he
doesn't know about. (Your parents met just once, at a masked ball ...)
 
Some of the PCs make it to Darkover (Cathryn the most recent, Zach, and
Rivka (of course) in the past) but you are Clarissa's project, and figures
them to be a destablizing influence, so you never knew ... with the
exception, occasionally, of Bridgette (or Shara) as Rivka was known there.)
 
-=> Whoa! Slow down!  I'm already 10 chapters in the hole!  Hey, does

Yes, they count as contributions (why it was 135 not 125) to offset the
lack of trumps so far produced (or any lack in the future <grin>)
 
And you get to wait till your next wish list for High Compelling, m'dear.
If that is what you want at that point ...

Hmm ... right ... it has been a while.  Yes, the predisposition towards the

Not necessary ... unless you really want to.  The "real" darkover that MZB
wrote about was a shadow of Clarissa's

Nope, it was just "random" that it finally worked.  She wouldn't know the
precice factors that pulled it off, but between native stubbornness, and
starting to learn patience, and persistance, you just keep going and going
...

Some of them, but Clarissa does point out how much that would take out of
you.  Both healthy for you and for the children, she would stress.

Not quite, she projected "herself" beyond this shadow, on raw psyche, using
the electrical potentials of her brain for a final boost.
 
-=> 2.  How exactly do you mean 'pure psyche'?  What exactly could she have
done?
 
Brand shadow shifted.  He changed the world around him, but since both he
and it have high durability, it moved him somewhere that matched.  (that's
not necessarily how all shift shadow, just Brand, of course) She tried to
change the entire world around her, with the power of her mind.  Squiggy.

No, he would not have known, he was non-local at that point.  You would
have known, because Faythe would have told you.  Faythe?  You don't know
how she knows these things, but our little Earth Mother has her ways.
 
-=> 4.  How old was she when she died?
 
Just into puberty or just pre.
 
-=> >Faythe's children are not equipt to live in the overworld in their bodies.
-=> Why not, too far removed?  Does this go for Faythe and Brandt's kid as well

Yes, too far removed from Clarissa and/or Oberon.  You're not quite sure of
the mechanic, but it is non-reinforcing. Your child by Brandt would have
the same abilities, not more than your child by Brand or by Brantd's
children, but you don't know this.

Shara is Rivka is Bridget, yes, the Ghodess Shara.  Cathryne might pick up

Darkover is at least as real as the place the primal pattern is.

I was yanking your chain, my dear, since you did (most wonderful) drawings

-=> Also...

Yeah, he would be wanting to, but ... well, things have been kinda busy

Is it original or is it beased off a fantasy/sci-fi book or series
somewhere?  Wouldn't going there have seemed, to her, like going to the
Terran Empire?
 
Also, Clarissa must have taught her well how to conduct herself on the
'outside'.
How much is known of Darkover outside?  How well known is that realm to
Amber? Would she know of any bans, preferences, restrictions or basic
'don'ts' for discussing Darkover on the 'outside'?
Darkover is a Realm by book definition, right?  It's 'real'?
I'm trying to get an in-depth feel for this.  So far, I've played Celeste
as fairly remote - no real information going out.

Ah. I see.  Thank you.  But...what lack of trumps?  Most GM's consider one
trump per session payment for the points.  What is your requirement?
 
Also...
Am I still studying with Darkstar?  Does he continue to tutor me in trump?
 
Later...
