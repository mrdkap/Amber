Well, that was actually the attitude I was trying to avoid... I hate pomp,
politics, and people that expect to get everything handed to them, so I'd
have a hard time playing this sort of character.  I was thinking more of an
unknown background (I don't have the faintest idea who my Amberite parent
might be, and prolly never even heard of Amber, the Courts, etc... this
would be good, since I don't know the Amberverse that well...)  And
preferably somone who has had a fairly hard life... this would let me be
cynical and rude on demand ;-)
 
I'm not real strongly attached to any of this...  has mostly just been
random thoughts that come to me while reading the logs on your website.

Background and connects are kinda hard for me to come up with, since I
don't know enough about your campaign to be able to come up with something
that fits in well...  But I think that you were implying above that you
would either take care of it or reshuffle it drastically to suit your
purposes...
 
I'm also curious... could I use some of my points to create a weapon with
nasty offensive properties, kinda like Julian's armor has incredible
defensive properties?  I have a hankering for a nasty black crossbow... ;-)

Hmm ... the easiest way to do that is to have the toy/pet that get's you
cross shadow also have some sort of magic well/short circut/defense built
in.  That way you aren't using it, but it is used on your behalf,
automatically.   If it is going to do that, perhaps a pendant would be
better than a stick?

Right, but since I willing (and wanting) to be fairly low profilish, I
would think this is fairly easy, no?  Since I'm not bringing and background
"baggage"... ie, my father *must* be so-and-so, and I am the head of *this*
house that has *that* power and *this* relationship....
 
The only thing here is that it might be good if one of the other PC's had
rescued me in the distant past... since I really need some sort of IC
reason to be hanging around with the rest of the gang.  Although I suppose
you could always fit a random meeting with one of the groups in some other
spot totally outside of amber, too.  It would just be nice to have *some*
sort of purpose.

Both of these have promise :)  I have a question tho... I'd rather make a
fairly magic-less character, but I've gotten the impression from the logs
that unless you are Benedict, the magic-users seem to be the key players
and the key powers.  Certainly whenever a fight comes along, it seems that
magic is a heavy decider in the conflict.  So, am I wrong?  Or would trying
to make a character that has little interest in the magical be highly
limiting?
 
And in regards to backgrounds... is continuing what we are doing now the
right way to go about this?  ie, write something, toss it your way, you add
thoughts, toss it back... or is there a different way it should be done?
Personally I like this... is rather fun and will prolly come out better,
but I figured I should ask :)

So this would be implying that I have some sort of magical innate ability
to shift shadow that is different from the shadow shifting that and
amberite who has walked the pattern can do?

Oh good :)  Making a character without flaws isn't any fun.  And making one
with flaws that don't ever come up in the game wouldn't be fun either.  But
really, given your personality, I didn't think there was any danger of you
not coming up with all sorts of evil things, even without my giving you big
wide openings :)

Fair enuff, but for my first public act of role playing, I really don't
want to wander too far afield.  Call it performance anxiety.  Or figure
since I really don't understand women a lot of the time (rhonda in
particular), how could I possibly role play one in a reasonable manner? ;-)

Hmmm.... going back to kill the boggle prolly isn't my style.  This would
be a tuff one, if the person I left behind is in the "true friend" category.

Yep.  And why shoot someone from the front if you have a shot from behind.
None of this fair fighting stuff, or keeping promises, especially if they
are forced on me.  Only exceptions would prolly be if it is convienent, not
dangerous, or made to one of the few friends I might have.

I think I like the Rat-ish idea better.  Something ugly.  I don't know what
to do here, tho, since I don't know what the possibilities are... I'd
prolly need to glance thru the manual for some ideas, since (unlike the
xbow) I'm don't have any strong desires here.  I just think a pet would be
neat :)  Auricle's gargoyle is a pet, yes?

Without any of the major powers (pattern, the magic suite, logrus,
shape-shifting) you are pretty much dependent only on stats and toys/pets.
That isn't bad, but it is a definite character decision.  Several of the
players have arranged some small pieces that way, but noone else tried
without pattern, yet.  Unless, of course, you want to have pattern, just
have it happen in game, as opposed to in history ...

Well ... walking the pattern allows you to effect shadow, not only to have
the ability to shift it (within you, not in some toy that could be taken
away) but also to affect it.  Most toys can take you either to a limited
(preset) set of locations, or follow someone else through shadow.  A few of
the really powerful ones can find specific things in shadow and shift
towards them.  You could also build in shadow manipulation to them (such
that your money is shifted by you to match the local currency) (which is
another benefit of pattern) and a few other things (like shapeshift other,
to get the shadows to lie for you too) and you will have a power item,
that, when the power is available, it will do just about everything that a
pattern walker can do.  Of course it will cost more than 50 points at that
level, and it still can be taken away from you, as opposed to being able,
given any place you can actually walk around in, to use the power (if it
isn't blocked)  You can also take other routes with pattern walk, where an
item cannot, you can Royal Way (slow, simple, easy changes) Walk (normal,
as per the book) or Hell Ride (faster, but dangerous), you can walk to a
place of your desire, you can walk to certain conditions, and the like.
You also, after walking the pattern, are by definition of the House of
Amber with certain rights and respects available to you.  There are a few
other perks of the power that I can't recall if are pattern or advanced
pattern (I'll have to check the rule book) but it is pretty impressive.
Oh, and you are somewhat of a logrus bane when you do take on the pattern.
It's kinda nice to have one major power as your ally, and a second at a
stand-offish distance.  The opposite would, of course, be granted for
walking the logrus, but then you would have to have grown up in the courts,
and have been selected by Suhuy (Logrus Master) and ... it is a much more
involved history, much different from what you have described to date.

-=> Yep.  Would give me a good excuse to be in the universe, too... searching
-=> for allies or some such.  Really have to solidify the previous piece of
-=> background a little, tho, first.  I also have to think about it a
-=> little... if this is one of my "true" friends, why did I leave him/her in

-=> they become a "true" friend?  do I still have enuff motivation to risk my
-=> life and time and indebt myself to other powers to affect the rescue?  Once
-=> I can answer all those, I figure I'll be coming along rather nicely...
 
Hmm ... let me help ... if this is the path you have chosen, possibly they
have given you the toy that allows you to escape.  They stole it at great
pains to themselves, and found they couldn't use it, and had been hoarding
it since.  You both discovered a way one of you could get out, and it was
decided that you had the better chance of going out and coming back with
help, so you were going to go.  At that point your friend brought this up
and had you try something, and it worked, since you could use it, your
friend gave it to you to help on your escape and return.  Your friend is
interested in liberating all the others held captive, but you are just
interested in getting your friend out.  The others you could care less
about.

Hmm ... the different bolts might be tricky, why not make all the bolts
with all the possiblilities, and then the powers that don't work in certain
shadows just won't activate.  Besides, how are you going to distinguish?
Building a single somthing with a set of powers is much less expensive in
terms of points than building a lot of little things with some overlap but
different powers.  On the other hand ... if you do it right, you can put
shapeshift other on the crossbow, and then you could use normal bolts (or

Something that fits either the rat or cat niche in a alien ecosystem would
be good.
 
That way you could have befriended it while you were imprisoned, and some

Well, you could design your toy, and pay temp points for it (so the gm
doesn't screw with it (much)) and have those points earmarked to go to the
pattern once walked (game mechanic) or you could simply not pay points for
your toy, and hope that I don't screw with it too badly ... (I might, I
might not ... I am a whimisical gm, if it's game interaction amuses me,
I'll probably allow it to continue)
 
As for Petitioning the King ... well ... currently there is NOONE in charge
in Amber.

The toy would have it, not you.  It wouldn't conflict with anything.

-=> Yes... lets see.  Figure a general rat configuration, but about the size of
-=> a large cat.  Nasty in a fight, but obviously only in conditions that favor
-=> its size.
 
What's its ancestry?  Mamal, rodent, marsupial, lizard, bird, some
combination?  How many legs/arms does it have?  Any of them have fine
manipulation?  Optimized for digging?  Optimized for running?  Claws?
Flame (out either end?)  Most of this is for free.
 
-=>  I don't think I'd want it to be poisonous or anything (poison is
-=> kinda like magic in my book... cheating...).
 
Is it septic (like a cat's claws?)  Acidic?
 
-=>  It should have some sort of
-=> special power of some sort tho... something to make it really neat, but I
-=> can't think of anything appealing at the moment.
 
Don't forget, it has to be part of an eco-system, with prey and some that
prey on it.
 
-=>  Ah....  Chameleon, or
-=> something related... either mundane (changes colors to match) or something
-=> more magical or phsychic that makes it hard to see/detect.
 
Psychically null is a possibility, alternate shape "invisible" is also a
possibility.
 
-=>  It's ancestors
-=> were tree climbers, but it is at home in tunnels and underground (not much
-=> of a digger, tho... can build the basic burrow, but no 100 yard escape
-=> tunnels).  It is rather ugly, scarred, and about as friendly as its
-=> master.  It would mostly used for scouting, fetching small items, guarding
-=> me while I sleep and that sort of thing.  Not sure what level of
-=> communication/intelligence would be good.
 
All that can be part of the design.  Ballance the points the way you wish.
 
-=>  Thoughts?  And guesses on point
-=> expense?  Expense will probably be an issue... between pattern, my xbow,
-=> and my pet, I won't have much left to buy stats (I'm looking for good
-=> warcraft, for my xbow, and endurance, as a testament to what I've had to
-=> survive).
 
OK ... we'll see what happens.

-=> So... this implies that I can have things that I don't pay points for that
-=> you can twist however your heart desires?  And also implies a level of
-=> protection for items that I do pay for?
 
Technically yes.  I'm not the only one that it would give you protection
from.  For example, if you paid for ... say ... a sword, and some PC stole
it, the chances are, it would make its way back to you, rather than be
(deliberately or accidently) lost.
 
-=> If this is true... at the moment, I'm leaning towards being daring (and
-=> perhaps short lived, who knows...) and not taking any of the major powers,
-=> but I really need to get my hands on the manual and look at exactly what
-=> buying into the major powers would get me before I could decide for sure.
 
Indeed.  We should get together sometime.  Movie night is cancled for the

it.
 
-=> If my assumptions above are correct, however, I'd be perfectly happy to

-=> survivor and a runner... not being in control of the externals of his life
-=> probably wouldn't be very unusual.
 
Right, but not paying points for it means you have to be real careful of
it.  People LIKE power items.

-=> Therefore.....

-=> trapped/exiled on this one.  The demon's magic feeds on the terror of other
-=> beings... thus as a "power source" he keeps a large number of prisoners
-=> that he has gathered and terrifies them to supply his magic.  Naturally the
-=> "stronger" the prisoner, the more magical power he would get from there
-=> terror... due to my ancestory, I was an excellent power source.  The demon
-=> discovered a relatively minor fear of closed spaces and exploited this,
-=> eventually turning a minor fear into full-blown ravening claustrophobia.
-=> (even years later, I am uncomfortable going inside buildings or crowded
-=> streets and it would take a serious act of will to get inside a car.
-=> Anything more confined... a very small room with no windows or narrow
-=> tunnel I would flatly refuse to enter.  If forced, I would probably go
-=> completely beserk, attacking anything in my path in an attempt to get out.
-=> I'm very sensative about this problem, as any incident involving it brings
-=> back a whole slew of memories from when I was confined and tortured.  I
-=> conceal it as much as possible, and would sooner provoke an argument or
-=> simply slip away if a situation involving closed areas comes up).
 
Sounds like a good start.  Not necessary even to be a demonic creature from
another shadow, just a powerful one.
 
-=> The demon's stronghold was a very odd place.  Either the entire place is in
-=> some odd dimension where nothing quite makes sense to a 3-D oriented
-=> person, or everyone inside it is held under the power of the demon's magic
-=> and mind, causing their perceptions to be skewed.  I never really had any
-=> way of knowing which was true.
 
Easy enough to set up, and might be of more than just those conclusions
<grin>
 
-=> I met a man named Mafatu while I was held prisoner by the demon.  He is a
-=> rather mysterious person who never told me much about his past.  He let
-=> enough slip for me to be sure that he is some sort of traveler between the
-=> shadows/planes, and was certainly not from my own world.  I am also sure
-=> that he is some sort of healer.  There were many dark periods when the
-=> demon pushed me a little too far that I remember returning to relative
-=> sanity seeing his face above me, eyes closed in concentration.  He never
-=> admitted it, however, even when directly questioned.
 
Wise man.

-=> My escape happened when someone tried to rescue Mafatu.  The event was
-=> sudden, and the details leading to it are lost in my memories, but suddenly
-=> the entire stronghold of the demon was shaking.  A woman was standing next
-=> to Mafatu, and I got the impression she was trying to remove something from
-=> his neck, although I had never seen anything around his neck before now.
-=> There was a flash of bright white light that sent her reeling to the floor
-=> and knocked a black crossbow that she was holding in her left hand spinning
-=> accross the room towards me.  As soon as the crossbow left her hand, she
-=> became well and truly visible for the first time.  Mafatu gave a cry of
-=> horror and lunged forward to touch her.  With Mafatu's help, she levered
-=> herself back to her feet, and peering at something that I couldn't see
-=> began chanting words that I couldn't understand.
 
Hmm ... ok, pretty good origin ... but what happens when she comes looking
for it?
 
-=> There was an earsplitting cry of pain, and for the first time since I had
-=> been confined by the demon, the world looked almost normal and I could
-=> think clearly again.  Near me, a battle was going on that I could only
-=> perceive the edge of.  The demon was focusing his entire might on the woman
-=> who had come to rescue Mafatu, and judging by the look on the woman's face,
-=> the demon was winning.  Mafatu spared one look for me and said, "Take the
-=> crossbow... the creature will not easily find you while you hold it.  Take
-=> it and run!"  He then turned his entire concentration back to the woman,
-=> doing his best, I thought at the time, to preserve her life while she
-=> fought.
 
Ahh ... I see.  Psychicly Invisable, confer.
 
-=> Scooping up the crossbow, I turned and ran.

The farther from the demon, the more ... jumbled ... it would become, much
to the effect that as you run the world would be running in the other
direction towards the battle (demon is drawing on his scattered powers, and
they are rushing past you to his assistance)

-=> No horsey.  At some later point, I pick up my pet... before I can figure
-=> out how, we really need to figure out how I travel... :)
 
Right ... how about your pet is your method of travel?  Or, hmm ... you
pick up the pet (who now likes you alot) when you killed the local
power-mage (that wanted to do the same thing to you that the demon did
(nothing personal, he was just doing it to the entire populace, one person
at a time)) freeing it from the bonds of being a bound familiar.  There can
be some interesting adventures in there ... and if you don't want your pet
to be your method, if you make your pet Psychicly Sensitive, it might be
able to tell/seek out magical items, to help you finish your quest.
 
-=> In the present day, I don't know if Mafatu still lives or not, but I
-=> believe he does.  The demon's attack seemed directed at the woman, and
-=> other then me, Mafatu was one of the demon's best sources of power... one
-=> that he wouldn't waste if he had a choice.  Mafatu was the first person who
-=> ever did anything for me without expecting anything in return, and for him
-=> to tell me to escape when he could have in my place confused me and my
-=> rather cynical view of the world.  While I will never understand why he
-=> would do such a thing, I still feel that I owe him, and I certainly want to
-=> see the destruction of the demon.
 
-=> Whatcha think?
 
Sounds GOOD!
 
-=> Oh, notice I'm attaching a chameleon/hiding/invis/whatever sorta power to
-=> the xbow here, too... :)  I'm not really looking for an absolute (complete
-=> invis or anything like that)... just a little extra edge.
 
Psychically Invisible, and Alternate Form, transparent?
 
-=> As for the exact details of the pet... I've still got the vague idea in my
-=> head, but the details of what it is and where it lives... they will work
-=> themselves out when I discover it.  I'd rather let the story lead into the
-=> characteristics of the pet rather then design the pet and try to fit the
-=> story of how I found it around the design...  more "real" that way. :)
 
Preferably for me as well, but some basics of the design should be there.
Shape, say, and inclinations.  Perhaps a general power level.
 
-=> Oh, and I'm a programmer, not a writer... so be nice :)  everything I'm
-=> coming up with I'm kinda just imagining wholesale and writing it down :)
 
This is just programming.  Reduce the problem to a previously unsolved
problem, and you are set ... right? <grin>
 
-=> Part of what I'm also trying to figure out is the exact personality of my
-=> character.  Not that he is cynical, etc, etc... but how exactly will he
-=> react when people say various things?  Is he friendly on the surface?
-=> Sarcastic?  He can't just snap at everyone or he won't get real far, but
-=> does he appear friendly?  Is he blunt?  A liar?  Quiet?  Loud and
-=> obnoxious?  His survival comes first, but is he obvious about it?  Will he
-=> agree to join groups and then abandon them at the first sign of danger, or
-=> will he just refuse to join?  Obviously a lot of this is situational, but
-=> I'm finding as I think this over that his basic mindset isn't enough... I
-=> need to figure out the next higher level of his mind so that I can role
-=> play him consistently and I don't have to stop and think everytime he says
-=> something so I can figure out how he would react...
 
Probably not very forthcoming and noisy ... tends to get one noticed, then
killed.  Remember the 'Rules of combat', and live by them type.  You can
check out my quizzes (off http://www.haven.org/~dkap/writings/Amber)  and
see if that will help you build pieces into your character.  I don't expect
him to spring fully developed out of your head (like athena) but some of
them might help.

Ok, so if I pay the 15 points to get sorcery, will that give me enuff to
make a spell that lets me open a portal from shadow to shadow?  Or do I
need more then that?  If it is, then I will probably take sorcery... I
think I can fit that into my view of my character, although I will probably
cripple it a little bit... perhaps limiting myself to defensive spells for
one reason or another or something like that.  I've decided I don't really
mind magic per say... what I mostly got a little annoyed at was that either
the (AD&D) mage was either useless or got some spell that never really gave
the opponent a chance... the "hold person" spell, for example, always
struck me as unfair... the critter/person you cast it on gets once chance
to save, usually only around 25% or so, or it is helpless.  On the other
hand, what else is a poor mage to do if they don't have any decent spells?
But I digress.
 
Anyway, if sorcery is sufficient, then I'll prolly end up taking sorcery,
although as I said, I'll be wanting to limit what spells I create, although
I don't really care if this is a personality limitation (I simply can't
bring myself to cast mind-invasive spells because of my own past
experiences... dunno what my excuse would be for offensive energy-type
spells) or a "hard coded" in game limitation... the person that I learned
sorcery from only new defensive magics, so I didn't ever learn the right
"way" to cast other spells, or simply that my "school" of sorcery
knowledge/ability only includes defensive-ish spells.  That is probably up
to you, not me, anyway.
In addition, I'll probably give my pet one of the weaker forms of the
"pattern walking" equivalent ability.  If the pet is too small for me to
ride, can it still take me with it?  My "pet" has gone thru a *lot* of
"rewrites" in my own mind.  At the moment I'm leaning towards a small flock
of shadowy butterfly like creatures, but I'll probably have changed my mind
within a few hours :)  For a while I wanted to make a tiger and load him
down with every one of the "combatish" powers, but I think I was just
undergoing powerlust... although the idea of a tiger that is psychically
invulnerable and has the max combat, strength, endurance, etc has some
appeal, since it seems like for 20ish points I could make something that
could probably tear apart most amberites.  But temptations aside, it really
isn't what I want my character to have.
 
Ooooooh.  Just had a thought.  Maybe I will make *three* toys...  my xbow,
my pet, and a simple pendant or something that I pick up from a mage that
lets me rack spells in it (the 2 pt version) and follow others that are
walking thru shadow (1 pt, I think).  That would solve some problems :)
After all, if the only power I buy into is sorcery, that would leave me
lots of points to have fun with.  Are there more advanced forms of sorcery
that cost more then 15 points?  I don't recall reading anything about
that.  If it exists, how much would it cost and what would it get me?
 
How will I buy attributes, exactly?  I can't be more powerful then whoever
won the auction in each attribute, right?  But I also won't know what
anyone else has (?), so will you just tell me the point value of the first
ranked person in each attribute so I know what I can't go over, and then I
just buy points "blind" ?  (blind, in that I have no idea if I'm "wasting"
points... for example spending 20 points in warfare when 15 would give me
the same rank).
 
Oh.  And I think I'll call my character "Krenth."

My father was a hunter for a moderate sized village (say 200ish people).
I never knew my mother; she died from a fever when I was very young.  My
father and my brothers never treated me well... my father was never loving
towards me, and I was very obviously different.  My father and brothers
were all heavily built and blond, while I was thinner, shorter, and
dark-haired.  Despite the indifference of my father and the outright
dislike of my brothers, I excelled as a hunter, proving a better shot then
even my father and surprisingly strong for my size.  I spent much more of
my time hunting then the rest of my family, mostly in an attempt to stay
away from them.
                                                                                    
During a famine, when most of the village was in danger of starving,
someone robbed the village church of its tithe of food.  I returned from a
fruitless hunting trip to find myself siezed and accused of stealing from
the church.  Somehow, several holy items where planted with my few personal
possessions, although the food was never found.
                                                                                    
I was scheduled for a sacrifice by the church for my crimes.  During the
night, I managed to break down the barred door of my cell in the church,
using my full strength for the first time.  The village priest heard me
breaking out and tried to stop me.  During the scuffle with him, I used too
much strength in my panic to get away and unknown to me at the time, I
broke his neck.  I escaped the church and found shelter in the woods.
                                                                                    
I lived safely in the woods for almost a week before a hunt was sent from
the nearest town.  Despite their dogs and their expert trackers, my
woodslore proved good enough to stay ahead of them.  During the next week,
I was driven far from my home village, managed to kill several of their
dogs.  One morning after having run for 8 days, a hunter surprised me while
I was laying yet another false trail for their dogs.  Shooting out of
ambush, he hit me in the leg, knocking me back down out of his sight and
sending my bow flying away from me.  I managed to crawl away without him
seeing me, and when he approached my former location to finish me, I slew
him with a thrown knife.  As I limped forward to recover my bow, I realized
the man I had killed was not only known to me, but someone I had known from
my home village.  Although I had never liked him much, for some reason
seeing him dead in front of me filled me with remorse, and I was suddenly
sick.  Horribly confused and sick with grief that I didn't understand, I
swore I would never kill another person again.
 
I bandaged my leg and continued to flee, but now I had to use all my skill
to avoid capture.  After several close encounters over the next 3 days, I
was far beyond territory I was familiar with and nearing the end of my
strength.  The wound in my leg was getting worse rather then healing due to
the constant use I was forcing on my leg.  Still I struggled on.
 
Later the next day, when circling back on my trail, I came apon a strange
sight.  In the clearing I had vacated an hour earlier, a lone figure
dressed in priestly robes and carrying a staff was carefully collecting
something from the ground.  He was obviously one of the hunters... but
remembering my vow not to kill again, I spared him when I could have easily
shot him.
 
An hour past dusk, with no warning, a shadowy transparent figure the shade
of dried blood floated into the clearing I was resting in.  There was a
brief pause, and then faster then the eye could see, the figure flashed
across the clearing and wrapped itself around my body.  Struggle as hard as
I could, I couldn't move as much as a finger.  I lay helpless, struggling
almost constantly for the next two hours until a torchlit procession, led
by a chanting figure in priestly robes, marched slowly into my clearing.
 
Over the next few days, I learned that I had killed our local priest back
when I escaped from the church, and that this killing had led to the
arrival of a high priest.  The high priest, whom I rapidly came to hate on
our two week journey to the nearest Greater Temple, was the one who had
cast the spell that led to my capture.  The high priest told me in
excruciating detail the rituals that would face me when we arrived at the
Greater Temple, and I began to have a cold, clear understanding of what my
foolish moment of weakness had cost me.
 
[ I was taken to the temple, underwent ritual torture, much of it at the
hands of the high priest whom I had spared, and then offered up for
sacrifice.  The standard method of sacrifice is long and rather
painful... at one point I blacked out and woke up imprisoned by the demon,
for whom I served as a power source for an unknown length of time (there
being no reliable way to tell day from night inside of his stronghold ]

-=> Here is an answer to one of the quiz questions that sorta grew.
 
Ahh ... it's good to be back ...
 
-=> My father was a hunter for a moderate sized village (say 200ish people).
-=> I never knew my mother; she died from a fever when I was very young.  My
-=> father and my brothers never treated me well... my father was never loving
-=> towards me, and I was very obviously different.  My father and brothers
-=> were all heavily built and blond, while I was thinner, shorter, and
-=> dark-haired.  Despite the indifference of my father and the outright
-=> dislike of my brothers, I excelled as a hunter, proving a better shot then
-=> even my father and surprisingly strong for my size.  I spent much more of
-=> my time hunting then the rest of my family, mostly in an attempt to stay
-=> away from them.
 
Probably she died during childbirth (yours of course) so the rest of the
family didn't necessarily know of the cuccolding, they were just disant
from you for you took away their mother/wife.
 
Not only that, but you never seemed to get any of the childhood sicknesses,
nor any of the plagues that blighted the village from time to time.  While
you weren't sick, you cared for your family which was (at times) and they
resented you even more for that.
 
-=> During a famine, when most of the village was in danger of starving,
-=> someone robbed the village church of its tithe of food.  I returned from a
-=> fruitless hunting trip to find myself siezed and accused of stealing from
-=> the church.  Somehow, several holy items where planted with my few
personal
-=> possessions, although the food was never found.
 
The famine wasn't casued by weather, but by the lack of people to work in
the field, during this, most recent, plague.  Which, of course, you didn't
catch.  You were also accused of bringing the plague down on the people,
for, obviously, part of your pact was not to get it yourself.
 
-=> I was scheduled for a sacrifice by the church for my crimes.  During the
-=> night, I managed to break down the barred door of my cell in the church,
-=> using my full strength for the first time.  The village priest heard me
-=> breaking out and tried to stop me.  During the scuffle with him, I used
too
-=> much strength in my panic to get away and unknown to me at the time, I
-=> broke his neck.  I escaped the church and found shelter in the woods.
 
You'd need more incentive to break out ... mayhap the priest had joined you
in your cell to beat a written confession out of you, and you snapped the
chains that bound you to the wall, so he bolted through the door and was in
the process of barring it when you hit it with your shoulder, knocking
both the door and the bar into him.  The bar drove a few of his ribs into
his lungs, so he would have died a nasty death, and he knew it, so he
dragged himself back into the room where you were chained, drew some
mystical simbols on the floor in his own blood, moved some spare chains
around to a compromising position, cut his throat, and then dropped himself
into the chains.  Just to make his death mean that much more in your
accusation.
 
-=> I lived safely in the woods for almost a week before a hunt was sent from
-=> the nearest town.
 
A hunt would have been sent immediately ... but you move faster than they
do, and it had to get past your line of travel, before they even "caught
up" with you.
 
-=> Despite their dogs and their expert trackers, my
-=> woodslore proved good enough to stay ahead of them.
 
Not just your woodslore, but your speed and ability to just keep going.
 
-=> During the next week,
-=> I was driven far from my home village, managed to kill several of their
-=> dogs.
 
Several of them you just ran to death, and some of them you left behind
you, in traps, as well.
 
-=> One morning after having run for 8 days, a hunter surprised me while
-=> I was laying yet another false trail for their dogs.  Shooting out of
-=> ambush, he hit me in the leg, knocking me back down out of his sight and
-=> sending my bow flying away from me.  I managed to crawl away without him
-=> seeing me.
 
Good.
 
-=> When he approached my former location to finish me, I slew
-=> him with a thrown knife.
 
When someone approached your former location, remember he shot you from
hiding, and you didn't see who it was ...
 
-=> As I limped forward to recover my bow, I realized
-=> the man I had killed was not only known to me, but someone I had known
from
-=> my home village.  Although I had never liked him much,
 
As you limped forward you realized the "man" you had killed was just a kid,
not even old enough to grow a beard.  He gasped out the last of his life in
your hands, saying something about he thought it was all just a game.  And
that he was cold.  There would be no way for a member of your village to
make it up to where you were ... you had too much of a head start.
 
-=> for some reason
-=> seeing him dead in front of me filled me with remorse, and I was suddenly
-=> sick.  Horribly confused and sick with grief that I didn't understand, I
-=> swore I would never kill another person again.
 
-=> I bandaged my leg and continued to flee, but now I had to use all my skill
-=> to avoid capture.  After several close encounters over the next 3 days, I
-=> was far beyond territory I was familiar with and nearing the end of my
-=> strength.  The wound in my leg was getting worse rather then healing due
to
-=> the constant use I was forcing on my leg.  Still I struggled on.
 
No, it was healing, fairly quickly for such a big wound, (the arrow caught
you sideways, ripping off the flesh from the side of your leg, as opposed
to penetraiting) so it was more of a nusance than debilitating.  But it was
a bloody mess.
 
-=> Later the next day, when circling back on my trail, I came apon a strange
-=> sight.  In the clearing I had vacated an hour earlier, a lone figure
-=> dressed in priestly robes and carrying a staff was carefully collecting
-=> something from the ground.  He was obviously one of the hunters... but
-=> remembering my vow not to kill again, I spared him when I could have
easily
-=> shot him.
 
Not obviously one of the hunters, but someone in priestly robes praying
over the (unmarked) grave that you dug for the kid.  (You dug it to
expidite your guilt, and was cursing yourself for wasting the time even
so.)  He was unarmed, and apparently not a threat.
 
-=> An hour past dusk, with no warning, a shadowy transparent figure the shade
-=> of dried blood floated into the clearing I was resting in.  There was a
-=> brief pause, and then faster then the eye could see, the figure flashed
-=> across the clearing and wrapped itself around my body.  Struggle as hard
as
-=> I could, I couldn't move as much as a finger.  I lay helpless, struggling
-=> almost constantly for the next two hours until a torchlit procession, led
-=> by a chanting figure in priestly robes, marched slowly into my clearing.
 
Hmm ... there was more of a chase than that, and it wouldn't have paused,
but still would have caught you ...
 
-=> Over the next few days, I learned that I had killed our local priest back
-=> when I escaped from the church, and that this killing had led to the
-=> arrival of a high priest.  The high priest, whom I rapidly came to hate on

And the "style in which you killed him".  The Grand Inquisitor (to give him
his proper title) was not the top ranked priest, but, for some reason,
everyone defered to him anyway.  You began to suspect that you had bitten
off more than you could chew, when he bound you in ropes spun from your own
blood.
 
-=> [ I was taken to the temple, underwent ritual torture, much of it at the

It looks like a good tale ... but you want to cut it off just before this
paragraph ... that way it can be continued later ... in a way.

Well ... not exactly the milkman ... but some romantic hero intrudes into

Closer to workable anyway.

You'd need the adrenals to overcome your trained "obedience to church
hierarchy" responces.  You'd also not realize your own strength there as
well.

Wooden, and he wasn't impaled (when you left, he was apparently just fine,
having ribs driven through your lungs doesn't kill you immediately.  He
knew he was dying, and therefore decided to make it as bad for you as
possible.  Besides ... he is that type of sadistic twerp ... y'see he was
cucolding your father first, and she stopped fooling with him for the
mystery stranger ... that's why he has always been looking for a way to put
you out of the way.

-=> I figured my town was too small to have dogs and people skilled in hunting
-=> humans, so the one week delay was in getting the hunters from the nearest
-=> town that was large enough.
                                                                                    
At that size, the towns had to be pretty self sufficient.  Only the
priesthood would be the connection between towns.  But they would have dogs
and those (more clumsy than not, but still) willing to hunt you down.

Well ... it was the fact that they aren't letting the dogs sleep, and the
dogs weren't able to catch up to you ... so yes, while in a "wind sprint"
the dog would still outrun you ... under these conditions, they would be
run to death.

Even at Amber stats you can outdo them when pressed by a large margin.

Well ... if it was through your leg, the hunt would have ended there
(severed muscle would force you ahead on only one leg ... and even with
your abilities, you wouldn't get very far at all) so it was a messy big but
not very serious wound.  And yes, it would be healing noticably.

So leave it blank, for backfill later.  Who knows maybe you will run into
one of your more memorable torturers later, and why they stuck in your
memory will fit here.  Or maybe you escaped (briefly) while held or
... leave the possibilities open, you never know when you have to add to
your past.

Ok.  I'm kinda paused at the moment because I'm no longer certain what I
want his present-day personality to be like.  There are plenty of
directions that I could still branch to and keep the fundamentals the same
(fundamentals being strong self-preservation, no sense of 'honor in
combat', claustrophobia).  I'm uncertain how I want the "middle"
experiences to be that would shape what face he shows the world... after
all, I could (to name a few) act the craven coward, the hard bitten
mercenary, the lonely hermit...  Originally I was headed towards the cold,
hard, enigmatic type that doesn't really show much emotion... but I have
since decided that this really won't be much fun to play.  Glowering at
everyone and appearing unaffected and unemotional about everything that
goes on around me isn't the point of an RPG (my personal opinion (tm)
here...) ... the point is to get into the events and emotions around the
character and become a part of the world... and trying to be the cold
emotionless type will really make that a lot more difficult, or so it seems
to me.
                                                                                    
So now I'm not sure where to go.  Once I realized where I was originally
headed and that it was bad, I started heading for the hermit... but that
style of character has some of the same problems as the cold emotionless
one.... after all, interacting with people is a key part of the game.
However, I don't want to play the total craven coward... that wouldn't be
much fun, and I'm not sure about the bitter mercenary, either, although it
would give me an excuse to have a high warfare (benedict is my hero :).
                                                                                    
In my mind, I'm not copping out on my character design here... my
fundamental character is decided and set in my mind... it is just what face
to show the world and how I will actually *act* that I'm not sure of at the
moment...
 
Any suggestions?
 
Dan
