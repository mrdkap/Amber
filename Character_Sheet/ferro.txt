-=> Good afternoon David.
-=>
-=> A few random thoughts (while I avoid work) on Marzipan Man.
-=>
-=> Apparenlty Dworkin created me in a fit of boredom while he was
-=> stuck in The Room Which is Now No Longer Locked.  Who knows who
-=> else helped him along while they were stuck in there as well...
 
Well ... Suhey did give him a ... <ahem> ... hand or two. <grin>
 
-=> Not having web access at work, I can't look up (or remember) all the people,
-=>  but I do recall Suhuy and Stormy were there at least.  Maybe they all took
-=> part and added their own little touches.  Suhuy tied pieces on
-=> with bits of Logrus, someone else used Trump to put the eyes
-=> in, Dworkin used Pattern for fingerprints, maybe a little blood
-=> coloring so I didn't look quite so marzipany, maybe a little
-=> shapeshift other when the proportions weren't quite right...  Mad
-=> artists and all that, I imagine it got a little competitive and
-=> somewhat silly after a short while.
 
Hmm ... the game log seems missing from those runs, but the end of
Malachai's Third journal seems to have coverd the begining of it nicely.
 
Now we just need to resurect the rest of it.  You are mostly Dworkin's
creation ...
 
Well at the table (I believe) was Suhey, Dworkin, and a few other
... highly powered individuals.
 
-=> (I can just picture them leaning over the marzipan giggling and
-=> saying things like, "The nose doesn't go THERE, and most of them
-=> ususally point outward.  If you leave it like that, he'll snort his
-=> brain.  And what would happen if he ever sneezed.  Heehee.")
 
Yep, that's about right.
 
-=> Apparenlty Dworkin's only use (that I know of at this point) was to
-=> have me go up and say "Bad boy, go to your room." to Oberon.  Maybe
-=> I was still a Marzipan Man at that point.  Maybe Oberon, in a fit
-=> of pique, decided that since he couldn't punish Dworkin and the
-=> rest, the worst thing he could do was make _me_ real, so I too would have
-=> to live with his family.  Then he told Dworkin to make sure I didn't
-=> go and get into trouble.
 
Well ... not quite ... y'see he has been having a small problem with people
and blood, so he wanted to make a child without blood, sort of as an
example and a threat to Oberon (you can be replaced Sonny-boy) and amped
you with enough power that Oberon couldn't simply brush you aside.
 
-=> Just some thoughts, since I have no idea what you had in mind.  It might be
-=> fun to play someone who is only three weeks old.  I have no idea what or
-=> how much background info whoever made me real imparted to me.  I'll guess
-=> I'll leave that up to you.
 
Dworkin only gave you a few instructions.  Remonstrate Oberon.  Be the good
boy that Oberon was obviously incapable of being (kinda vague, expect to
fail at it), and don't forget to walk the pattern.
 
-=> ooh, ooh, a name occurred to me - Dar-med.  Hmm, maybe.
 
Sounds good to me.

Hi David.
 
Lori is asking me to send you this qeustion (her hard drive controller just
died):
        I have a bunch of the Darkover Books, which ones should she start
reading to get a flavor for your Darkover?  From her limited description,
I'm guessing at ones before the Earth rediscovered it.  If you let me know
before I go over tonight, I'll bring some along.
 
 
Also for my own character (name:  Ferro Marz), here's some stuff about what
he's likely to have been doing in recent days, and a general description as
well. The plusses in the stats, indicate where points not spent on powers
go.

        Appearance:     Nordic.  Being a shapeshifter Ferro can generally
look like whatever he wants.  For comfortable person to person interaction,
he's developed a humanoid form.
                He generally appears like:      long, yellow/blond hair
                                        blue, elfin eyes (occasionally sparkling)

(earth-shadow-wise)
                                        clothing is shifted to whatever is situationally
appropriate
 
 
Character History:
 
        Ferro was originally created out of marzipan primarily by Dworkin
during an enforced stay in The Locked Room.  Suhuy and the other
inhabitants of the room also likely took part in the creation.
 
        Ferro was created to chastise Oberon, and because of some problems
Dworkin was having with people and blood at the time.  Ferro's first
conscious recollection is walking up to Oberon and saying, "You've been a
bad, bad boy.  Go to your room."
 
        Dworkin's only other instructions were, "Go and be a good boy, and
don't forget to walk the pattern."
 
 
Happenings since then:
        Pre-game
        The group was released from the Now No Longer Locked Room, and were
free to wander about Amber Castle.  Ferro, not having any clue where he was,
 and knowing only the people from the room, hooked up with George, the
golem taking care of Gerard's child (daughter?).   Off and on over the next
few weeks, Ferro helped George take care of the child, and George is
teaching Ferro some very basic interpersonal skills.
 
        Ferro, quickly realized that people don't react well when they're
talking with someone who looks like he's made of pastry.  So, he learned to
shift his form to a more pleasing aspect, and came up with the
humanoid-type description above.  He also found out that shape-shifting was
a great deal of fun, and practiced a lot.  George, particularly likes his
parody of Oberon being a bad boy.
 
        Ferro grew bored with just helping out George. Since George seemed
perfectly capable of caring for the child on its own, Ferro felt like a
little useless.  He still helps out occasionally though, so he and George
can chat, and because he likes the little tyke.
 
        Bored, Ferro began to wander about Castle Amber to see what it was
like.  He thought he should get to know his way around anyway (and the
pattern's got to be around here somewhere).
 
      Over the next few weeks he occasionally came across servants who
looked like they needed some help.  Being a selfless, generous man,
(obviously not an Amberite yet) he offered to help when he could, not
realizing of course that a child/creature of Dworkin really shouldn't help
to catch the rats in the storerooms and such.  This course of action went
over really well with the servants and the other workers though.
 
        In his wanderings, Ferro noticed that the Castle was looking
particularly run down these days.   ...just some scrubbing, and minor
repairs, and this place would really begin to look nice again...   So in
typical selfless fashion, Ferro decided to clean up the place, starting
with the attic, with an occasional foray down to clean out the dungeons in
case Oberon ever needed them for prisoners.  ...I wouldn't keep my worst
enemy (even if I had any) down here in this filth...  It never occurred to
him to ask anyone for permission.  The servants thought it was eccentric,
but OK as long as they didn't have to do it (he did ask them to scrub the
burn marks off the walls in the dining room though).  And it kept Ferro out
of the way in the relatively unused portions at the top and bottom of the
castle, so no one disturbed him.   It gave him chance to practice shifting
in quiet as well, so he could get to those hard to reach places.
 
        He's only cleaning out the attic in small doses, because there's so
much neat stuff up there.  Every time he goes up he gets distracted by
stuff after a short while.  So he's allotted himself a couple hours for the
attic each day, before he moves on to the unused rooms on the upper floors.
  
 
        The other place Ferro spends a lot of time is the library.  Assuming
Dworkin gave him the capacity to read, he's reading, if not he's learning
how.
 
 
That's about it for now.

Very basic.  As in "don't step on them".  George doesn't seem to be able to
do much else.

Fortunately or unfortunately, only you seem to be able to communicate with
George.  Somehow vocal apparatus was left out of his design.
 
-=>     Bored, Ferro began to wander about Castle Amber to see what it was
-=> like.  He thought he should get to know his way around anyway (and the
-=> pattern's got to be around here somewhere).
 
Very methodically checking every room you come to.  George is patient, and
probably will check the rooms too, y'see he is looking for Gerard or
Velaria.

Especially since you are REALLY able to help.  I mean, spreading yourself
out into hundreds of little creatures (the one drawback of your
shapeshifting seems to be, while you can control many seperate actions at
once, you can't change your mass at all) all of them hunting rats at once,
is really effective.

Yes indeed.  Oh, and when you ran into a servant who was trying to get in
one of the storage rooms (he had to put this stuff where he was intstructed
to, but he couldn't seem to approach for some reason), you just went in to
help him.  And wasn't hindered by it. (Whatever "it" may be.)
 
-=>     He's only cleaning out the attic in small doses, because there's so
-=> much neat stuff up there.  Every time he goes up he gets distracted by
-=> stuff after a short while.  So he's allotted himself a couple hours for the
-=> attic each day, before he moves on to the unused rooms on the upper floors.
 
There are bunches of "attic" rooms, store rooms for various folk.

                                                                                     
-=>     The other place Ferro spends a lot of time is the library.  Assuming
-=> Dworkin gave him the capacity to read, he's reading, if not he's learning
-=> how.
 
Hmm ... and probably repairing some of the books, and maybe writing his own
on cleaning methods, for there didn't seem to be one on that, which is
why you went there in the first place ... but somehow you got distracted
along the line.
 
-=> That's about it for now.
 
Sounds good.  See you Tuesday.
