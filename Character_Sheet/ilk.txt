Subject: rough draft of char stuff
 
 
Here are some rough ideas about the character from talking with you at
the past two movie nights... I thought that I might as well get some
feedback from you on it before fleshing anything out too thoroughly.
 
dave
 
 
 
Naturally, tell me that I'm being crazy if anything here clashes with
common sense or pre-existing chunks of your universe.
 
A decent chunk of this is invalid, in light of our conversation on
Monday. However, I'll leave it in so you can laugh at it. :)
 
>From what I can remember of what we talked about Monday, here's a more
accurate description.
 
<name>  (I'm lousy at coming up with character names)
 
Cousin to the heirs of house Cara, wants to raise the status of his
house and his own status within the house, culminating in his being the
chief advisor to the head of the house. Good friends with one of his
cousins (probably not the heir, but his younger brother) - they grew up
together, explored shadow together, and customized their own shadow
together. More about the shadow later. More recently, <name> has been
teaching his cousin some of the more advanced portions of logrus
mastery.   <name> is currently fairly young (300-700?)

Studied the logrus under Suhey; worked his way up to journeyman, and
then started learning magic. I'm not sure how many points I'll have
-- I'd like him to start with sorcery and conjuration so he can
have built a staff that he can hook spells on, but that will probably
not happen.
 
He is contemptuous of his father for not taking some form of action
against his brother before the line of succession was firmly established
down that path.
 
He learned basic swordwork, like all members of the Courts, but usually
carries a staff due to the defensive superiority of a staff, as well as
the standard magely/sagely image associated with same.  Always dresses
neatly and precisely. Will don a chainmail shirt (under the outermost
layer, of course) when he is expecting a cross-shadow battle - otherwise
he just pops off an "invulnerable to normal weapons" spell on his
clothing when combat starts.
 
Q for the GM: is it considered poor form for someone other than the
ruler/heir of a house to wear the house colors? What are the colors of
house Cara?
 
Q for the GM: is it possible to spend part of the 10 points to upgrade
>from chaos to amber level stats, in order to be between the two levels,
like the half-ranks in the ladders?
 
Talk about the shadow here.  <Shadow> definitely contains a power source
that he commonly taps for his sorcery.  <name> keeps a self-teleport
spell targeted on his keep in this shadow, for a get-away-quick spell
(one lynchpin only (?) )
 
When warring with his cousin, he tends to practice his heavy-firepower
spells, hanging as many as he can fit the night before a battle then
showing up and frying everything in sight (except for his cousin, of
course) in interesting ways. His cousin tends to respond by entering the
next battle himself and personally decimating <name's> army.
 
Question for the GM: what titles are there in house Cara? Would a nephew
to a head of house count as a noble? A Lord of Chaos? Pond scum?
 
------------- old stuff -------
 
 
Random assortment of ideas:
 
Considers Mandor to be a role model. Doesn't want to rule - wants to
tell the ruler what to do. Member of a minor house, one of the ones that
is trying to become a major house. Not in the direct line of succession
- possibly first cousin to the heir(s).  On good terms with them - since
he was far below them in the order of succession and their father was
still actively working on producing heirs, he was less mistrusted by
them than each other. About the same age as the 2nd oldest cousin,
fairly good friends w/ him.
 
 
crude rep of possible family tree:
 
              grandpa (dead)
                  |
                   |

   |                         his father      |
   |                              |          |
   |                              |         (?)

heir apparent |               +---------+
        |     |               |         |
        |     |               |         |
    2nd son   |              him        |
              |                         |
              |                      (maybe a younger
            yet another kid            sibling)
            
 
Wants to become indespensible to the future rulers, so is trying to gain
powers of a miscellaneous or arcane nature. Fairly young, only a few
hundred years old.  Possibly studied the logrus under Suhey (or someone
wimpier), learned basic sorcery from his father, and is wandering shadow
in order to broaden his experience. Hasn't wandered into the
pattern-dominated areas yet. Tends to return home regularly, to touch
base with his family.  Probably has trumps for his cousins and his
father. Wants to become a powerful sorcerer - never was highly skilled
with a blade, tended to concentrate on more defensive combat arts, like
staff.  Possibly carries a staff.  Clothing varies, from robes through
pants, but always dresses neatly and precisely. Almost never seen
wearing armor, but might put on a light chainmail shirt under his outer
layer of clothing if anticipating a major battle.

I decided that if I waited to finish all of the quizzes before sending
anything to you, I'd be waiting forever. Here's one section...
 
 
 
 
HYPOTHETICAL (30) Answer in character please.  Answer in full, feel free to
                  take as many pages as you wish.
 
1. If you were an object, you would be...
 
Ygg. I'm not sure why, but it just feels right.
 
2. How long do you expect to live?
 
I have no intention of dying, so forever.
 
3. Could you be successfully kidnapped?  How would you react to that?
 
Yes, if faced with probable death, I'd allow myself to be kidnapped. I'd
wait until the odd combination of circumstances that blocked my escape
and their vigilance declined, and would then leave. Next, kill the
kidnappers by any means necessary, up to and including nuking entire
regions of shadows with primal chaos. Finally, I would find out who
was behind the kidnapping and destroy them, in the most agonizing and
humiliating means possible.
 
4. What would you change about your parent if you could? Why?
 
He was born a few decades too late, and never had the ambition necessary
to become truly powerful. He's a competant swordsman, a decent psionic,
a fairly good mage, and competant at manipulating logrus energies, but
never excelled at anything. He's a nice, harmless, friendly person who
didn't even try to become heir to our house. Now it's too late for that,
so the best that I can do is try to raise our house's status and become
indispensible to the current rulers.
 
5. Plan your perfect funeral and wedding.  What would be different if you
   were planning them for your best friend?
 
The perfect funeral would definitely have to include the lack of a
well-identified body, and a twinge of doubt on everyone's faces as to
whether or not I was truly dead. If the funeral was for my best friend,
then ideally I would know where he was actually hiding out, and I'd be
using the funeral to try to help discover who was attacking or
threatening him. Wedding? Hmm.... beats me.  I've never really groked
the wedding thing.
 
6. Do you think you would make a good parent and why?
                                                                                      
I have no desire to have children at this time - maybe in a thousand
years or so.  Children occupy too much of one's time in order to raise
properly, and if you're not going to do it right, why bother?
 
7. What would be the worst tortures for you (physical and psychological)?
 
Watching my family die slowly, one member at a time, and then being
left alive and framed for the murders.  Physically, I'm not sure.
Probably being cut off from the Logrus and any magical sources of power,
and being given a link through which I could observer happenings in the
outside world, but not affect them.  No, wait - that's psychological
again.
 
8. Under what circumstances would you consider torturing someone else?
 
If they had done me some harm in the past, if I knew that they were
planning harm on me in the future, if they had some information that I
desperately needed, or if I felt like it at the time.  Of course, real
people have a slightly higher standard of evidence.
 
9. Describe who would be your perfect date?  What would you do?
 
Since Dave has never been on a date (all of my relationships kinda
skipped that stage -- traditional dating is very rare at MIT, people
just go from "close friends" to "close friends who are sleeping
together"), I have no idea what happens on them, so couldn't explore
those possibilities in-character either.
 
10. How much do you value human life?  Are chaosians "human"?  Are shadow
    dwellers "human"?
 
Real creatures are human, whether chaosian, amberite, demon, or other.
Shadow critters, on the other hand, are another story entirely, unless
they have some manner of cross-shadow power (magic, broken pattern,
etc), or come from a primal plane, then aren't just shadow creatures.
However, if they're just shadow creatures with some magical tricks, then
who cares? I could probably build another one with the logrus.
 
11. If you weren't caught up in current events, where would you be and what
    would you be doing?
 
Exploring shadow on the far edge of the influence of chaos, finding,
challenging, and destroying shadow-mages in order to gain practice,
continuing to play with my shadow to enhance my skill with the logrus
and force of will, studying with Suhey occasionally, engaging in the
occasional war or battle to gain skill in those areas, and learning as
much as I could of the politics of chaos and amber.  Since House Cara
has tied her destiny to the predominance of Amber, familiarity with the
politics of Amber could become very useful.
 
12. Under what conditions would you refuse a trump call? Which would you
    forgo if they were pushing it?
 
Since trumps are very rare on the chaos end of things, I haven't had to
deal with this situation in the past. If I was in the middle of a duel
that required my attention, or was busy swimming in the Sea of Chance,
I'd be far less likely to answer than if I was staring at a wall, bored.
 
Of course, that depends on who had trumps of me that I knew of. If the
only trump was in the hands of my cousin, I'd be more likely to take an
inconvenient trump contact than if the only trump was in the hands of my
dad.
 
13. If you were able to have any additional single power, item or ally,
    what/who would it be and why?  What would you be willing to sacrifice
    to get it?
 
Possibly Corwin's pattern. Actually, it might be entertaining to start
collecting the imprints of as many sources of power as I can find. Let's
see... there's the Logrus, Amber's pattern, Corwin's pattern, Fairy,...
What would I be willing to sacrifice for it? Well, certainly not any of
my existing powers. I've never been the sacrificing sort.  I'd be
willing to split my time farther to aid various people, since those
contacts and powers will pay off for the House in the long run.
 
 
14. Which of the family do you feel trusts you the most or is closest to
    you?
 
That would have to be the as of yet unnamed cousin with whom I am
sharing Home. (hey dkap - I need a family tree for House Cara at some
point)
 
 
15. A film is being made about your life.  What genre would it be?  Who
    would play the lead?  The chief supporting cast?  If there is a co-star
    that stands out, who would it be?
 
Genre, heroic fantasy/superhero/dangerous liasons. As to the actors,
well, dave doesn't do the hollywood obsession thing. No clue...
 
16. For several months now, you have had an uneasy feeling and last night's
    murder confirms your suspicions.  Someone is after you and is not about
    to let your friends or staff get in the way.  Unfortunately for you,
    this person has been quite good at concealing their identity.  What is
    your next move?
 
Inform my cousin and possibly a few friends of the matter, and head Home
to set an ambush for this assassin.  If anyone can take me out in Home
when I'm fully prepared, well, there's not much that I can do about it.
If no ambush happens within a reasonable period of time, I'll start
using magic and logrus to search for the assassin, and assassinate them
myself.
 
17. It's a relatively calm, peaceful time and you decide to take the Royal
    way for a shadow walk.  Describe the highlights of your journey.  (If
    you are incapable of doing so, pretend you have found an item that
    allows you to do so.)
 
It would be a fairly jerky Royal way, with many radical swings in
environment. A virgin forest, a giant museum filled with exquisite works
of art, a medieval battlefield, a short stretch through outer space,
perhaps a jaunt through Flatland,...
 
18. A secret admirer has sent you a gift, you open the package to discover
    a book.  What's the title?
 
Finnigan's Wake
 
19. You've just received word that, due to some dalliance in Shadow, you
    are soon to be a parent.  How do you react to this news?  Aside from
    the obvious problems this raises if you are the one that is pregnant,
    how will this change the upcoming months/years?
 
That would depend entirely on who the other parent is. If it's just some
shadow creature, either ignore the whole matter or take her on a tour of
shadow -- including a Pern-style ride on dragonback.
 
If she was someone with whom having a child would be a valuable
connection (Clarissa, Cassandra, Fiona, Dierdre, etc), I'd take a few
decades off to help raise the kid, and probably tame down a section of
Home for use as a playpen.
 
20. It's been a miserable day; nothing has gone right, which has left you
    in a really foul mood.  You need to blow off some major steam.  What do
    you do?
 
Find a nice little war somewhere in shadow and win it, utterly
destroying both sides with a large number of seriously overpowered
destruction spells (nuke, explode flesh/rock,...), and perhaps some raw
chaos as well.  Toss in a bit of hand-to-hand in my chaos form for good
measure, and I should be considerably calmer afterwards.
 
21. Someone just pulled a practical joke on you and got you *good*.  What
    did they do and how did you react?  How would you retaliate?
 
Probably tampered with Home somehow. Since that is my only true
possession, it would be the most likely target. Perhaps modifying Home
such that my shifting is off, and I have to spend a while in a safe
pocket restoring the sequence of shifting to one of my choosing.
Retaliate by returning the favor a few years later. I like to think that
I have a good sense of humor...
 
22. You've just been ambushed and are barely holding your own.  Your Trumps
    have been destroyed or knocked out of reach and you see no way to
    escape.  Suddenly, you get a Trump call.  You answer desperately,
    hoping for an ally, but it turns out to be someone you don't really
    trust at all.  They offer to pull you out and give you safety if you
    promise to do them a favor in the future.  Do you accept ?
 
Yes, of course. Naturally, any favors that would hurt my house would be deemed
imappropriate...  I'm hard enough to kill or pent and have enough ways
to move through shadow that I'm not particularly worried about that - I
should be able to *bamf* away from any ambush that doesn't instantly
kill me.
 
23. Describe your death, as you feel it will be.  Is there an 'afterlife'?
    If so, what is it like?
 
My death would probably involve a close encounter with the Pattern,
which tends to be rather fatal. Then again, Merlin walked Amber's
pattern after having navigated the Logrus, so that might not be the
case. It would almost definitely be quick and messy.  I've never bought
into the idea of religions, although it would be interesting to try to
detect a person's spirit - perhaps by studying the resurrection
techniques used in Drageara - and then attempt to use those same
techniques in other shadows, and eventually on primal planes or on real
people. Hmmm... I'll have to add another item to my To Do list.
                                                                                      
24. Is there anyone that you wish *didn't* have a Trump of you?  (This is
    not necessarily only enemies; include people you would not have given
    your Trump to, had you had the choice.)
 
My father. I would rather not be easily contactably by him when I am not
in the courts.  (of course, given chaosians' usual attitude towards
trump, he probably doesn't have one anyway)
 
25. If you had a pet, what would it be?
 
The chaosian equivalent of a ferret, or possibly a wolf - except wolves
make far better companions than pets.  One of these days I'll have to
find and befriend a pack of wolves with some shifting ability - they
tend to make good company.
 
26. How would your father describe you when you were growing up?  and now?
    What about your mother, then and now?
 
dad:
Serious, but with an odd sense of humor. Studied hard, played harder,
and tried to combine the two whenever possible. Now, he never seems to
be around when I look for him...
 
mom:
?
 
 
27. Supposed you feel lonely for companionship.  Write up a personals ad.
 
Lord of Chaos seeks lusty, well-connected babe for long, intimate
travels through rapidly changing environs, midnight dips into pools of
primal chaos, and all of the other joys that only shapeshi<lost>
to one another. Pattern initiates need not apply.
 
28. If there were scandalous rumors being told about you, how would you
    cope?
 
If they were being spread by shadow critters, destroy them. If they were
being spread by real people, find out why they are spreading them,
make the rumors appear foolish and absurd, and then over the course of
the next several decades, either destroy those who started the rumors or
return the favor, depending on whether or not the rumors were intended
to be harmful, or merely amusing.
 
29. If a police raid or an abduction (assuming it would succeed) broke into
    to your sleeping quarters, how would they find you sleeping (prone,
    supine, hanging like a bat :) How would you be dressed? Would you be
    alone?  Do you have a Teddy bear?  What does the bed-chamber look like?
 
They would find me floating in a zero-G pocket, in my chaos form. And
then my wards and defenses would destroy them. The appearance of the
bedchamber changes constantly - the only fixed feature is my bed, which
changes appearance as well, but always acts like a zero-G pocket.
 
30. If someone were to give you the perfect gift, what would it be?
                                                                                      
A power source of my very own (Pattern, Logrus, etc.)
 
31. Do you believe in higher powers influencing you or other members of
    your family?  If so, what are they and what are the influenced actions,
    and if not, why not?
 
Suhey counts as a higher power in my book, and he influences matters
constantly.

Defensive spells: (D)
 
D01 Dune Shielding
  - This creates a field that acts like Dune shields -- anything

    nature of the spell in question

So, how much power would you recommend pumping into a damage-causing
spell? (Magical Energy)? 5? 10? 20?
 
I don't really have a good feel for the effectiveness of different
levels of power, so it's hard for me to rate the spells properly.
 
Just a vague rule of thumb... you said that I could keep up ~10 spells
with ~10 minutes of maintenance per day. Is that ~150 total complexity?
100? 300?

  - complexity: 6
 
D03 Impact Armor
  - This makes the target's clothing invulnerable to normal weapons

   Query for structure/reasonableness oh a couple of spells:
 
   M12 Healing
     - lend energy towards strengthening the target body, mind touch to
       dampen pain
     - lynchpins of MoS, target
     - B4, C10, D1
     - complexity 17
 
Umm, you'd need advanced shape shifting our really huge endurance to do
this one, otherwise you are just pouring energy into a body that is already
trying to cope with something.
 
<stamp> DENYED
 
   M09 Paint Target
     - Let's paint the opposing general an interesting shade of puce...
     - spraypaint "AMBER SUX -- CHAOS RULZ" on the side of Gerard's ship.
     - I cast the spell, then paint on a canvas in front of me, and that
       color/pattern paint appears on the target object, scaled
       proportionately.
     - opens a shadow gate to a place filled with paint, colors the paint
       appropriately in a small container on this side of the gate, and
       then releases the paint via a nozzle as indicated by the canvas.
     - The nozzle's end on this shadow is specified by two things, the target
       lynchpin and the canvas/brush (yet another lynchpin). The paint
       emerging from the nozzle is colored identically to the paint that
       was just placed onto the canvas, and the nozzle movement is
       controlled by the brush's movements.
     - max duration, 1 hour.
     - lynchpins of MoS, target, canvas, dispel word
     - A2, B2, C1
     - complexity 9
 
Umm, simpler, just open a gate to a place swirling with colored paints, and
use your logrus tendrils to direct and choose colors.
 
Making the spell follow your painting is much to complex.
 
   Also, I have a couple of spells that have multiple targets. How can this
   be specified in terms of lynchpins? Is it one lynchpin per target? One
   per plus one to specify the number of targets? Is the list of targets
   null-terminated?   For example:
 
N+1 lynchpins where the 1 is the count.
 
   BA05 Forked Lightning
      - Pick multiple targets, and spray zippy electrons at them,
      - same process as Lightning Bolt, but more power, and multiple paths.
      - lynchpins of MoS, number of targets, target, target, target,...
      - A1, B3+targets, C5+targets
      - complexity 11+3*targets
 
   and
 
   FA08 Tim's Tap
      - causes minor explosions and plumes of fire at five specified
        locations
      - modeled after _Monty Python's Holy Grail_
      - opens five gates to a shadow with plasma under high pressure, and
        lets a decent amount out.
      - lynchpins of MoS, target, target, target, target, target
      - A5, B5, C1
      - complexity 17
Easier to just modify the shadow at those spots to be significantly hotter,
rather than opening a gate.
 
   On a different note,
 
   Who is in House Cara? Do the various people have names yet? What are
   House Cara's colors?  I've been considering using black, midnight blue,
   and a deep green (almost aquamarine) for his colors - does that clash
   with anything currently existing?
 
Umm ... the house doesn't have specific colors (yet) if you and the other
house members want to get together and do something about it, you can.
 
REN is currently Cara (head of household) no current heir contenders
besides yourself, now that your cousin is dead. (Or has that not happened
yet?)
 
Personal colors are personal choices, some of the amberite's colors
clash/copy I don't see why Chaosian colors need to be fixed much less
worried about matching/clashing.

Here are some new spells that I'm going to research ASAP. Three of them
are standard (disarm, shatter weapon, and flight), but the rest are in a
new category, Anti-Mikail. :-)
                                                                                
Basically, I now see the need for heavily overpowered spells to deal
with people that I can't logrus-thwack. Almost all of them are
complexity 30 so take 5 minutes to cast if I haven't hung them
already, but...
                                                                                
All of the Anti-Mikail spells will be researched after I've done a bit
of study into the Mikail simalcrums, the amulets on those simalcrums,
and Mikail's demons, and will be tailored appropriately.

But, you now have time, after your headache has passed, to hang them.

   of study into the Mikail simalcrums, the amulets on those simalcrums,
   and Mikail's demons, and will be tailored appropriately.
 
The amulets just basically stop them from being affected by non-point-value
weapons.  Nothing special.  The simalcrums simply are animated dead flesh.
Nothing special about them either, except that they have traces of pattern
in them.

Won't work on him probably, being an amberite, you can't manipulate him as
shadow.

You need advanced/exaulted shape shift to pull this one off on an amberite.

You can do so, but as a warning, you don't think that these amulets are
what protects Mikail, that deamon was doing the job in the sky.

You aren't really versed in those arts.  And the second series isn't cannon
(for example, as far as anyone knows there is no such thing as a broken
pattern)

I'm glad to hear that.  My well wishes in his endevors.

You wouldn't have to, and technically couldn't, for it is part of his

Maybe, but in chaos, the long knives are usually provided by other houses,
internally, they are much more aware of who to inhume, and the other houses
usually aren't that particular.
 
   For now at least, I'd rather be concentrating on improving Cara's

My Things To Do list for the next run:
 
1. Grab a mikail amulet/clone
2. Dispel those teleport blocks, esp the one that could be contributing
to that riot by not letting anyone escape by teleportation (at least
chaos is generally faster than amber/drageara)
3. Dissect a mikail amulet/clone.
4. Research Mikail's demons
5. Create/hang some anti-mikail spells
6. Take Cathryn to a fast shadow and try to dump some quick defensive /
target-finding techniques on her before her duel with julian.
7. Go Mikail hunting w/ Cathryn
 
Logrus Research:
 
* Try to do what Cathryn did to repair that statue with the logrus
* Experiment with Suhey's pixilated hologram technique

Yup. Hey - he's the first truly worthy opponent I've had to play with in
decades, ever since my cousin started spending more of his time in the
Courts and less time playing war. I don't actually want to hurt him -
just take him down and ask him how in the world he escaped that teleport
block and knocked me back several shadows.

So, how much pattern will give me a nasty headache or bounce me across
shadow? If an advanced logrus user thwacks a basic pattern user, what
happens? Basic logrus vs advanced pattern? Logrus v pattern-tainted
items? And when one becomes more skilled with the logrus, do the effects
of pattern increase or decrease?

For those effects, is it because he is an amberite, or because he is
real? Are chaosians as hard to effect in that fashion as amberites? What
about primal-plane dwellers?

Could I pull it off on a chaosian w/o high-powered shapeshifting
ability? Mandor has apparently challenged Bleys to a duel because he
turned Dara into a hat rack - would that imply that bleys can
shapeshift, or just that he was using a different kind of / more
powerful form of magic?

I'm not sure how yet - hopefully after studying Swift Edges and
Galleon-type demons, I can figure out a way to modify shadow to make
them stuck, like anchoring a non-magical pattern-weenie's feet in
concrete...

   happens? Basic logrus vs advanced pattern? Logrus v pattern-tainted

The amount of pattern in the simulacrums just lead it as a tracer, nothing
more (as in they will twig as containing pattern if one was to search for
such, but not much more than that), so you still don't have a scale to
measure that on.  This is something that you would probably have to resolve
in play.

   about primal-plane dwellers?
 
Chaosians are easier to manipulate than amberites, chaosians are used to
modifying themselves to match the enviornment that they are currently
within.  Amberites tend to be immutable.  And it depends on the primal
plane and its dwellers to answer for them.

More powerful magic than you have available to you. (He has pattern magic,
and basically rewrote her.)

   I'm not sure how yet - hopefully after studying Swift Edges and
   Galleon-type demons, I can figure out a way to modify shadow to make
   them stuck, like anchoring a non-magical pattern-weenie's feet in
   concrete...
 
Ahh, gotcha.  We'll deal with that from your research.

Subject: run tuesday
 
 
I think that I'm going to be very late for the run this week - packet
handout for an assassin game this coming weekend. How much detail should
I give you for Ilk's actions?  I guess that he could spend most of this
run doing research, but I really doubt that he's going to find out
anything interesting, esp considering that any further info about the
demons is probably going to have to come from scott. :)
 
A few questions... those amulets protect the wearer from non-'point'
weapons. Do 'point' weapons only include things that were bought for
character points, or do they include things that were conjured or found,
like the stuff mikail makes and ilk reaches out and grabs?
 
More experiments w/ the mikail-clones: do the amulets only protect
against direct physical attack? Will a logrus tendril effect the clone?
A zot of magical energy?
 
Some potential spell ideas...
 
Wet Cement, a defensive spell that modifies a shell around the target
point such that anything trying to move through it gets stuck.  Designed
with the thought of not being perforated by Swift Edges in mind, but
should also be usable in the more general case.

                                                                               
Nobody's Home II - a more pumped version of the psychic/trump blocker
designed to protect against a pumped conjurer who is also one of
clarissa's kids, and therefore probably a psyche monster.
 
Swift Edges Hunter-Killer (SE H-K): creates a magical shaped charge that
homes on the nearest/specified SE, and fries it on impact.
 
Double-Barrel SE H-K - fires two SE H-Ks
 
SE H-K Machine Gun - starts firing SE H-Ks and continues until dispelled
or it runs out of magical power.
 
Banish Demon(s) - teleports the specified/nearest demon to a drab shadow
with very little logrus influence that by it's very nature makes it
difficult for the demon to move out. Also 'covers it's tracks'
afterwards by erasing the teleport trace. The 'demons' variant tries to
banish all of the demons within the specified area; if no target area is
specified, it takes the caster as the center and works its way outward
>from that.
 
Erase Teleport Trace - obvious
 
Untraceable Teleport - ditto
 
Raise Dead Shadow Dude - like the spell from That Other Game. Scans the
required chunk of the critter's flesh, and clones it, then re-creates
the psyche from impressions left in the flesh, or by reaching out and
grabbing the 'soul' or 'spirit', if such things exist and are grabable
in your universe.
                                                                               
Contingency - cast, then the next specified number of spells cast are
effectively hung on the contingency spell itself, which fires off its
spells according to algorithms specified when the contingency spell
itself is cast.

Don't have enough jets to do so.
 
   Swift Edges Hunter-Killer (SE H-K): creates a magical shaped charge that

Just make it there, rather than the complex homing.

You would have to do a demon summoning to do a banish.  Since you didn't
summon these, you can't banish these.
 
   Erase Teleport Trace - obvious
 
How?  You don't know of any way.
 
   Untraceable Teleport - ditto
 
Again, how?
 
   Raise Dead Shadow Dude - like the spell from That Other Game. Scans the

   the psyche from impressions left in the flesh, or by reaching out and
   grabbing the 'soul' or 'spirit', if such things exist and are grabable

You don't have the jets to swing it (advanced conjouration/high compelling)
 
   Contingency - cast, then the next specified number of spells cast are

Subject: Stupid Logrus Tricks
 
 
Bear with me if the train of logic derails or appears to be heading off
a cliff, I'm looking for general info about the nature of what you can
do with the logrus (hey, for 70 points there's got to be something
worthwhile to do with the thing) as well as hunting for stupid logrus
tricks.
 
All of my "is it possible to X" questions have the implied follow-up of
"Can I do X, and if not, how far beyond my grasp is it?"
 
------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #1 ----------
 
When pulling onself through/across shadow using the logrus, the first
step is to reach to the destination and 'latch on', right?
 
Is it possible to translate onself contiguously within a shadow with the
logrus in that fashion, reaching out, say, 50 feet up, and then reel
yourself in?
 
Is it possible to reach out with the logrus and grab your present
location and hold yourself in that location, to provide for a form of
levitation?
                                                                                     
Another question: Is it possible to move the tip of a logrus tendril?
For example, dip the end of a tendril into a lake, then spray water
around with another end of that tendril or another tendril connected to
it?
 
Can one then reach out with the logrus and grab your present location
and then change the point that you are grabbing contiguously to simulate
flight?
 
How about reaching out with the logrus one foot ahead of your current
direction and pulling yourself contiguously through space along the
tendril, while moving and growing the tendril in the direction that you
want to go, such that you are effectively continously laying track in
front of the train in your intended direction, and then re-absorbing it
into the train as you pass over it?
 
-------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #2 ---------
 
Is it possible to link tendrils? For example, could I dip one tendril
into a lake to provide input (and pumping pressure, temp control, etc)
and then have 20 tendrils playing firehose?
 
Is it possible to use the logrus to project or throw something else into
close proximity of a pattern-weenie? For example, throwing rocks or
flechette-gun style rock chips, or directly throwing bullets?
  
How about doing the above firehose imitation, but with the 20 firehoses
at the vertices of a 20-sided regular 3-d solid (like a d20) spraying
inward, with a pattern weenie at the center?  How about piping lava or
molten metal through the tendrils instead of water?  What about piping
primal chaos instead of water?
                                                                                     
-------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #3 ---------
 
Is it possible to create a self-contained bundle of logrus energy with a
program controlling it? Is that logrus magic?  Can I do it?
 
Example: set up a series of hard, heavy, sharp, or otherwise physically
manifested logrus tendrils spinning or moving rapidly to block the path
of or strike a pattern weenie, but having the effect of logrus v pattern
contained to that logrus manifestation, quite possibly dispelling it,
but not causing feedback damage to myself?
 
Example: Soften an area of rock using the logrus, and then stick a sword
into it. Set up a few logrus tendrils to anchor the sword into the rock,
and that chunk of rock to the fabric of shadow, such that the sword
cannot be pulled from the stone, the stone cannot be moved, and if the
stone is chipped away, the sword remains hanging in mid-air?
 
Mod to above example: Set up a tendril with orders to block any attempts
to chip away the stone, so it would either wrap itself around the stone,
or move to block any attempts to do stonemason tricks. ?
 
Ditto: Weave a logrus tendril through the rock, such that even if the
rock is smashed into powder, the powder is held in place by the tendril?
 
Ditto: Add an end condition to the setup, such that the specified end
condition (the right person touching the handle?) results in the spell
softening the stone, releasing the sword, restoring the stone, and then
going away?
 
Example: Wrap a message in a logrus-envelope that will only open when
touched by the logrus-"signature" of a specified person?
 
All of these would be spoofable by someone with more logrus than myself,
of course...
 
-------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #4 ---------
 
How precisely can physically-manifested logrus tendrils be shaped? For
example, can I create a nice blunt tendril to straightarm or clothesline
someone charging at me? Can I create a nice sharp tendril to run someone
through?  I know that I cannot easily pull or push Real people or
objects across shadow with the logrus, but can I whack at them with
physical tendrils?
 
Can I pick up a Real person/object with a logrus tendril and physically
translate them, w/ no shadow movement?
 
Can I reach into a Real person with a logrus tendril and solidify the
tip of it inside their heart? Their brain?
 
Reach inside someone, grab their heart with a physical tendril, and
rotate it 90 degrees?
 
-------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #5 ----------
 
Is it possible to use logrus to modify shadow?
 
To modify shadow in such a way that the molecular bonds between
molecules in the effected area become weak or dissolve, effectively
disintegrating the substance?
 
To raise or lower the freezing/boiling point of substances?
 
To raise or lower the conductivity of a substance, creating an
electrical superconductor or insulator? A thermal superconductor or
insulator?
 
To pinch off a section of shadow, creating a pocket shadow containing
whatever was in that section?
 
Could I pinch off a section of shadow, and then carry that pocket shadow
around with me, like a bag of holding?
 
Could I create more rooms in a house that wouldn't fit there by opening
up a mini-shadow and setting up a quasi-permanent opening to that shadow
in an otherwise blank wall?
 
-------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #6 -----------
 
You mentioned when I generated my character, that he had enough logrus
power to create/control primal chaos and survive in the Sea of Chance.
 
How well/how long could I survive in the Sea of Chance?  Navigate in the
Sea of Chance?
 
Is magic operational in the sea of chance? Can I do other logrus stuff
while in the sea of chance, or am I too busy keeping myself intact?
 
How much Primal Chaos could I create? Enough to melt a person?  A city?
An entire shadow?
 
How much Primal Chaos could I suck from the Sea of Chance/other sources?
Enough to melt a person?  A city?  An entire shadow?
 
If Ilk was splattered with Primal Chaos, would he melt, spend lots of
effort protecting himself, spend lots of effort destroying it, or
merilly suck power out of it until it was used up?
 
To what extent can Ilk destroy primal chaos?
 
To what extent can Ilk control primal chaos? Can he shape it? Move it?
Form it into a ball and go bowling? Swallow it? Gain nutrition from it?
Convince part of it to form into something and remain stable as that
something?
 
--------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #7 ------------
 
A initiate of the logrus can reach through shadow and grab stuff. What
are the limits on this? I know that sending out for a pizza, or for a
4-point sword is fairly standard. What about...
 
Sending out for a car?
 
Sending out for a house or a tower?
   (separate the foundation from the surrounding rock and pull...)
 
Sending out for a castle?
 
Sending out for a city?
   (grab the bedrock, slice it away from the surrounding rock, and
    pull...)
 
Sending out for a moon?
   (I don't like the color of this one, I want a moon made ouf of green
    cheese...)
 
Sending out for a planet?
   (I wonder what would happen if I put Jupiter _there_ ?)
 
Sending out for a star?
   (I'm cold...)
 
Sending out for a black hole?
   (I'm suicidal...)
 
----------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #8 -----------
 
Can one protect oneself against involuntary teleportation or trump
gating by anchoring onself into their current place with the logrus?
 
----------- Stoopid Logrus Trick #9 -----------
 
Can I cause a tendril to have a physical end that picks up vibrations
in the surrounding medium and transmit them back as sound?
 
How about picking up light and transmitting that back?
 
Picking up pheremones and other scents?
 
Can I cast a magical spell through a logrus tendril?
 
------------
 
Hmm... well, this message is getting a bit long, so I'll chop it off
here.  More to come later, but probably not today.

Subject: amber stuff
 
So, I've been kicking around ideas for the next wishlist, even though
I'll end up completely changing my mind over the next 6-12 months. It's
up to 130 points for an ideal wishlist, which raises damn near
everything. It's somewhat gratuitous - raise all stats, exalted Logrus,
exalted Sorcery, full Conjuration, fully ubiquitous Logrus, including
cross-reality navigation (To the Bob Logrus, James...) and possible
movement, advanced Shapeshifting, lots of points towards generic Allies
in Chaos, Amber, Faerie, and Clarissa, and lots of points into several
shadows.
 
Upon expanding out the run log and thinking over the situation when
fully awake, I've come up with more questions to pose to my copy of the
badger brain: When did you acquire the artifact? Who gave it to you, and
under what circumstances? Do you have or know of any plans that will be
happening during the next day or two? What's the deal with those boxes?
Do you leave the artifact behind when you invade? Why? Will you or one
of your buddies notice the lack of the artifact? How often do you check
on the lab? Why don't you not check on it for the next couple of days?
 
Speculation - so these (partially?) Logrus-powered rings are
mind-controlling badgers into taking over a Primal shadow in which
Logrus doesn't work.  24 chaos artifacts strikes me as a major effort
just to conquer a shadow, even if it is a Primal fairly close to Amber.
Who had the rings made, and who gave them to these badgers?  Why? Why
not just take it over themselves?  Whose stomping ground am I playing on
now? Are the rings sending off distress calls to their true owner, who
will show up and be Unhappy RSN?
 
Future lines of investigation - study the rings and the hooks, and see
if the rings can be controlled via the hooks, and, if so, can a hook can be
faked? Ideally, I'd like to neutralize the controlling aspect of the
artifact(s), and use their Logrus around here, since that would
hopefully give me a greater degree of control.  Can these rings be
disabled and stored safely somewhere where the Logrus is blocked, like
in the Primal badger shadow?
 
Other generic questions for da GM:
 
I know that the Sea of Chance is dangerous, but can Ilk (with full
Logrus) navigate and move through Chaos Storms and Shadow Storms that
are happening in shadow, since he can access the Logrus from there?
 
What is the second rung on the Psyche ladder? Since that's the next one
for Ilk to hit, knowing if it costs 5 or 25 points would greatly help
future wish list development. :)

Subject: Re: wish list, v1.0
 
Hmm. I didn't really define a number of points for magic, thinking to
dump whatever was left over into it. Hrm. I'm not sure how many points I
want to put in, because I'm not sure how many points are needed for
various things. I don't know if logrus-magic costs 5, 15, or 150.
 
There are a number of other frobs that I'd be interested in (pumping
Home, possibly acquiring another shadow or two, possibly sticking a
limited number of points into a replacement staff to possibly make it
less likely to explode, and so on, if I expected to return to the proper
reality any time soon. However, since you seem to have more-or-less
permanently split your run into (our) Amber and (other) Ambers halves,
and Corwin has pulled the ejection cord on Perl, I'm not sure what good
that would accomplish.
 
I don't even know if I can work on Home from here. If I was going to
stay in the reality where Ilk is currently, he'd want to acquire a
shadow or three, but why spend points on a shadow he may never visit
again?
 
Would it be appropriate to spend a point on some of my power depots?
Northern Power Depot A should be fairly powerful at this point,
considering that it absorbed a decent portion of a de-rack via the
Cosmic Grounding. And it also might be nice to have a staging ground...
err... waystation... a bit closer to Amber, as well.
 
WRT allies -- I had thought that the 5-6 points for Suhey covered pretty
much everything in Chaos. Should I be planning on expending more for,
say, connections to house Jesby (we did seem to get along during C's
duel), or for demons that I've associated with in the past?
Additionally, it seems that the only allies that he could acquire
currently are mostly shadow-lame, with one (somewhat amorous)
exception.
 
Oops - I forgot a category of magic. Tech-magic; magically powering
technology that would otherwise not work there. After dealing with this
badger plague problem, he'd like to spend a while in that shadow with
the space battles and investigate their technology and how to
exploit/use it or similar technology in other shadows.
 
Also, would it be possibly to buy off unfriendly logruses, allowing him
to actually use logrus in realities that aren't his own without getting
munched?

-=> Does Ilk think that a shadow storm would be more effective against

Shifters, Mages could escape much more easily, so it would be a waste.

-=> Lord Rainbow; I was wondering if you might have any objections to one
-=> attempting to demonstrate the lethal nature of that trap you mentioned
-=> by dropping a few members of House Helgram into it.

Interesting ... if you wished to go forward with it, that would be good
wording ... but remember, it is primed for Darkstar ...

Cas, and Cel left when Zach entered.

Though I can't seem to find my list of those houses that seem to have

Well ... actually they are going to use this opertunity to try and
reconnect with the cadet branch ...
