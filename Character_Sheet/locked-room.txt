Subject: Oh, Rhiannon! (Amber stuff)
 
 
This takes place after Rivka has wandered over and is chit-chatting
with us at Oberon's Locked-Room Party(tm).
 
(These ideas are not in any order.  Go with the flow.)
 
Rivka: Well, I don't know if it would do any good, but if you want to
try any experiments on pairs of polar opposites, without endangering
reality...  Auricle and I can shapeshift, so I could do Clarissa and
she could do Titania and you could try experimenting with the tensions
between us.
 
Auricle: Although it might help if I knew who Titania was.
 
Rivka: Ask Zach, he can point her out.
 
 
(New Idea)
 
Auricle and Rhiannon: Looking for a good analogy of the description of
the tensions between polar opposites, we can liken it to a pair of
magnets, either being forced apart of pushed together.
                                                                                
Rivka: Or it could be more like a pendulum, a child on a swing.  If
so, the perturbations could be caused by a very small push, at the
same point in its arc.
 
Auricle:  In either case, enegry is being added into the system,
either by the pushing or pulling of magnetic forces or by the pushing
of the pendulum.  If we can pinpoint where the energy is being added,
we should be able to graph a sysem that would give us some insight
into the mind of workings of whatever is causing the tensions to
increase.  This assumes, of course, that the fraying of reality is not
merely a natural phenomenom we have absolutely no control over.
 
Rivka: Well, we're kinda limited in our search for perturbations
(voice grows darkly ironic) by being locked in this party.  Rhiannon,
didn't you say you could get around that somehow?
 
Auricle: (completely missing that Rivka's said something) And we could
start searching by interviewing the polar opposites we have present --
as well as anyone with a sufficient life-span -- here in this room.
We would need to search through their memories for about the last, oh,
1000 years.
 
Rivka: By the way, Rhi, I don't suppose you can also do research back
in time?
 
 
(New Idea)
 
Auricle: We should consider asking Oberon for some clarifications.  I
mean, what exactly does he mean when he says reality is fraying?  Is
it actually fraying?  Or is that the only analogy he could produce on
the spur of the moment?
 
Rivka: If reality is literally fraying, we should be able to hem it,
right?
 
Auricle: (sounding both intrigued and puzzled) How exactly would you
"hem" reality?
 
Rivka:If reality is fraying, that means that threads are unravelling
around the edges.  All we have to do is get one of those unravelled
threads, thread it through a cosmic needle, turn reality's edges under
twice, and start doing blanket stitch.
  
Auricle (trump contact with Gargoyle): Gargoyle?  Does that make any
sense to you?  And if it does, how could we acheive it?  Any ideas?
 
 
(New Idea)
 
Rivka: If the problem is related to increasing tension between polar
opposites, what about poles without opposites?
 
Auricle: Rhiannon, you mentioned that Corwin had inscribed a second pattern?
 
Rivka: Pearl.  Hmmn.  Last time I was in Pearl, they seemed to be
fighting a war.  I wonder who against?  Perhaps Pearl's opposite.  At
the very least, Pearl is in conflict with something.  And what about
other unpaired poles?  If Chaos existed before Amber, what was its
opposite then?
 
Auricle:  And what about this alternate-Amber?  Does it have a polar
opposite?  Possibly a second Chaos?
 
Rivka: Rhi, weren't you going to talk to <ahem> that rather striking
gentleman about his alternate Amber?  That aside, maybe poles without
opposites will be the only things to survive reality fraying apart, if
the fraying is based on conflicting opposites.
 
Auricle:  Ahh, like little islands of stability.  If you're right, we
ought to warn Corwin that Pearl may become a refuge.
 
Rivka: I don't think Corwin made it into this meeting.
 
Auricle: Well, we have to have Oberon let us out so we can warn him,
then...  Or, Rhiannon, perhaps you can contact him?  Corwin, I mean?
 
(New Idea)
 
Rivka:  Those guys with the hourglass eyes seemed  to think that
Malachai hadn't been born yet, or something.  Maybe if we could get at
his memories from before he showed up in this timestream, we could
find some clues.
 
Auricle:  Does he remember anything?
 
Rivka: Not from that far back, or forward.  At least not consciously.
Speaking of memory, maybe we could find something in your memories, if
you had them, Auricle.  After all, what memories you have seem to
connect to the Pattern somehow.  Didn't you say that you had
incorporated elements of the Pattern into your Gargoyle design?
 
Auricle: Well, all my memory is actually from the time after I woke up
on the street surrounded by street urchins.  With the Gargoyle.  And
everything from that point.  The only unduplicated memories I have --
well, they're duplicated now, as I've remembered them -- are of Castle
amber and of great pain associated with the Pattern.  Rhiannon, I know
that walking the Pattern infuses the walker with great power.  Does it
also impart memory or knowledge to the walker?  If it does, we should
see about having Malachai walk the Pattern -- either Amber's or
Pearl's.
 
 
Rivka: Auricle, maybe you should try walkng the Pattern.  After all,if
you remember great pain associated with it, at least you survived to
remember something!
 
Auricle (shudders, and some of the color fades from her clothing):  I
did say "great pain", didn't I? (her voice turns puzzled) I thought I
did.
 
Rivka:  Well, the memory does suggest that you walked it at some point
and survived.  Perhaps we should ask Oberon about those who have
walked the Pattern in the past and are currently unaccounted for.

Bloody stupid, that. If you'll give me a moment, I'd like to try
suggesting to Oberon that while a Trump transport block might not be the
worst idea (I think it is but I'm not saying so), perhaps he could
permit communication.

That's a novel approach. I have no idea what experiments we might
formulate though, particularly since I doubt it's the people themselves
being directly manipulated...but rather, the powers they represent. We
would need to try affecting the power-bases they represent and draw
upon, I think.

That's a very interesting idea. With a lot more historical data than we
have right at hand, we might be able to quantify certain aspects of each
conflict and find some periodic effect. For that matter, the 600 years
we've been talking about could only be the period during which
cumulative effects have been observable; if you're on the right track,
Rivka, then we'd need to observe your mother and Titania's interactions
considerably further back -- long before the dreams stopped.
  
 Mi> (voice grows darkly ironic) by being locked in this party.  Rhiannon,
 Mi> didn't you say you could get around that somehow?
  
Unfortunately, Grandpapa's little power play has cut off communication
as well as transportation. My database is accessible mainly by Trump. I
could try a combination of Trump and magic, but I'm willing to bet that
magic is damped down as well.

 Mi> as well as anyone with a sufficient life-span -- here in this room.
 Mi> We would need to search through their memories for about the last, oh,
 Mi> 1000 years.
Longer, I think. 600 years is just how long the effects have been
apparent to the casual observer. If we start with Clarissa and Titania,
Ii'd say we need to go back at least 1500, maybe 2000 years. And that
might tell us how much further back to look for First Causes.
  
 Mi> Rivka: By the way, Rhi, I don't suppose you can also do research back
 Mi> in time?
  
Bugger it all for a lark...I don't *think* so, but components of my
system had long-term memory functions before I incorporated them. There
are things I could try, but I have my doubts.
  
 Mi> mean, what exactly does he mean when he says reality is fraying?  Is
 Mi> it actually fraying?  Or is that the only analogy he could produce on
 Mi> the spur of the moment?
  
You know, that's been bugging me too. Heightened antagonism among the
powers is rather a different thing from the undermining of the physical
nature of Substance and Shadow.
  
 Mi> threads, thread it through a cosmic needle, turn reality's edges under
 Mi> twice, and start doing blanket stitch.
  
<laughter> I love that. The only problem is that reality wasn't cut with
a seam allowance that large -- it won't fit properly afterward! :)
  
Let me take that out of the analogical for a second. What you're
talking about doing is finding the places where the physical nature of
Shadow and Substance are most strained, and merging layers of Shadow on
the principle that the added density would make it strong enough to
resist the force pulling at it. Very, very interesting. I think I could
do something like that, where Shadow is affected. Where we're dealing
with Substance, Dworkin and Suhuy working together *might* have a shot
at it.
  
 Mi> Auricle (trump contact with Gargoyle): Gargoyle?  Does that make any
 Mi> sense to you?  And if it does, how could we acheive it?  Any ideas?
  
<blink blink> Auricle, who's Gargoyle?
  
 Mi> Rivka: If the problem is related to increasing tension between polar
 Mi> opposites, what about poles without opposites?
  
Tough question. The only one I know of really is Pearl, and it's
altogether possible that either it called some other force into being in
a system with Corwin's primal Pattern as the only tangent point to ours,
or...<dumbfounded look> Rivka, what if some other force *already*
*existed* at some level we couldn't normally access, causing effects on
our reality-system from outside? Effects that destabilized our system,
and eventually, indirectly, *led* to the scribing of Corwin's pattern?
Sort of like a cometary body in space being captured and drawn into
stable orbit by a nearby star's gravity well? There would be a shakeup
in the orbital dynamics of that star system, but it would eventually
reach a different equilibrium...or if there were another sizeable body
close enough, a binary system could be completed by the new influence.
  
Am I making any sense?
  
 Mi> Rivka: Pearl.  Hmmn.  Last time I was in Pearl, they seemed to be
 Mi> fighting a war.  I wonder who against?  Perhaps Pearl's opposite.
                                                                                
If Pearl does have an opposite, then we couldn't reach it directly. We
can't reach Pearl herself directly from this reality-base -- tangential
contact sucks that way. But if the analogy to gravitational effects
holds, a body of power drawn in that close to us could certainly set
things awry, couldn't it?
  
 Mi> other unpaired poles?  If Chaos existed before Amber, what was its
 Mi> opposite then?
  
Oooh, hadn't thought of that. <points to Suhuy> There's somebody to
ask...my suspicion, though, is that there was no opposite and Chaos was
even more unstable than it is inherently now.
  
 Mi> Rivka: Rhi, weren't you going to talk to <ahem> that rather striking
 Mi> gentleman about his alternate Amber?
  
<Rhi chuckles, leaning toward Rivka and touching her hand. While in
physical contact, she nudges for psychic rapport on a communicative
level. Do you let her in, Rivka?>
  
I've heard some things about it -- quite similar to ours except for some
minor quirks of physics and divergences in history about as far back as
his lifetime. They do have a Chaos, apparently quite similar to ours
except that it never went to war against Amber. Obviously we have to
pick his and Ivy's brains for every differing detail we can find;
somewhere in those divergences may be a clue.
 
 Mi> That aside, maybe poles without
 Mi> opposites will be the only things to survive reality fraying apart, if
 Mi> the fraying is based on conflicting opposites.
  
And what are those? We don't know for sure about Pearl and whatever
state Chaos was in before, it's got us now.
  
 Mi> Auricle: Well, we have to have Oberon let us out so we can warn him,
 Mi> then...  Or, Rhiannon, perhaps you can contact him?  Corwin, I mean?
  
Afraid not. I wonder if Oberon realizes Corwin isn't here.
  
 Mi> Rivka:  Those guys with the hourglass eyes seemed  to think that
 Mi> Malachai hadn't been born yet, or something.
  
I can't understand more than a few indefinite articles of their speech,
but then I haven't tried to address them directly yet. Shall we go try?

 Mi> Auricle: Well, all my memory is actually from the time after I woke up

<ahem> Pardon me, but who or what is Gargoyle? If your memory starts

Memory...yes. According to Corwin, he'd lost portions of his memory and
walking the Pattern restored them. But Malachai's walked the Pattern
already, before the war. And since we only know Corwin adopted him and
we're not sure of his blood, putting him on Pearl's pattern could be
very *bad*.
  
<GM Note -- was I able to find out anything availing on that last point
when I checked over Malachai for lingering effects after he took in all
that power and dumped it to me? What effect did it have on him, was the
energy as adversarial to him as to me, &c.?>
  
 Mi> Auricle (shudders, and some of the color fades from her clothing):  I
 Mi> did say "great pain", didn't I? (her voice turns puzzled) I thought I

The Pattern really ought to either leave you exhausted from the strain
of walking it -- it's one hell of an ordeal, lots of hard work but I
don't know that I'd call it painful as such -- or kill you outright.
There are special cases, of course. <eyeing Oberon> But those involved a
*lot* of intervention.

Rivka: Well, if you can talk Oberon into letting us out, you might try
reinforcing Shadow layers.  If it seems to do any good, then we can talk
to Dworkin and Suhuy.

Auricle and Rivka:  Yes.  You're making sense.
 
Auricle:  Actually, that's a beautiful hypothesis.  Simple, elegant, and
seems to fit the known data. But, how would we test it?  If the already
existant force is normally manifested at levels we can't access, where
would we even start?  We can't get outside of reality, can we?  Or maybe
we could ride on of the unravelled threads, so as to peek outside?
 
Rivka:  But if it somehow caused Corwin's Pattern to be drawn, then it
has had a perceptible effect upon reality.  Perhaps if we better
understood the relationship between the reality of Corwin's Pattern and
the somewhat stable state of reality before it was drawn.  I'm not sure
what to do, but I would bet that Pearl, or someone who has walked
Corwin's Pattern, would be a good place to start.

Titania can reach Pearl just fine.  And what she can do, I bet Mom can
do, too.

Auricle:  If the tension between poles is our major clue to the
problems...if they haven't had those symptoms, I'd definately expect any
divergences to be of import.  Especially where major polar opposites
*didn't* do things that happened here.  It would probably be a good
indication of where energy was being added into our system, using our
pendulum/magnetism model.

Auricle:  Well, if your information system is your obelisks, then I
remember before it appeared in my Shadows.  Quite a long time before,
actually.  And if that is your system, we should work out a an equitable
trade of information at some point?  i don't object to it being present
in my Shadows, you understand, now that I know what it is, i just feel --
oh!  Right!  What the Gargoyle is.  [Taps a box, about the size of three
videocassette tapesstacked together, attched to her belt.]  this is
Gargoyle 6.7.  Gargoyle, meet Rhiannon and Rivka.  Well, you already sort
of met them, but anyway.  Gargoyle is my...continuity source.  Well, I
think.  It might just be a computer.  But not really.  Hmm.  Well, it
likes me.  [she pats the box lovingly for a moment.]  And I do know it
knows everything I know, but nothing before that.  the moment i woke up
surrounded by urchins, that is.  It has no memory of anything before that
time.
 
I hope that helps.

Auricle looks rather fascinated, but she could still be thinking about
the Gargoyle.  It's kinda hard to tell.

Auricle [shrugs]:  That's all I remember.  Great pain and the Pattern.
Of course, there are elements of the Gargoyle that correspond to the
Pattern, but I'm not entirely certain why.

All right then. Rivka, you seem to know more about Clarissa and Titania
than any of us, maybe you should take the lead in that inquiry. Since
the two of them seem to be having it out over there <David said the
various pairs had descended into their own squabbles, right?> we should
be able to hear both sides of the story as far back as we want.

David: Rhi is wandering over to the Grand Ole Man for a moment. Umm,
King Grandpa, did you notice that Uncle Corwin didn't get inside before
you sealed the room? Some of our inquiries are bound to concern Pearl
and his pattern, and he would be the one to ask. Besides -- how much
investigating we can do without access to outside information sources
could be a problem. I have a huge database that could be quite useful,
but I can't even make Trump contact.

First we need to be sure of what we're talking about -- whether there's
been actual physical degradation as well as people getting upset. We can
get some clarification from Clarissa when we speak with her, I hope.

It would be accessible from Pearl, via the shadows she casts. The
problem is that only those who can walk Corwin's pattern can get to
Pearl, far as I know. Or <looking intently at you, Rivka> as far as I
*knew*. Do you have some way in there directly, or were you Trumped in?
 
What I'm thinking of as a least hypothesis is that somewhere out there,
at a place which until recently had no contact point with our realm of
existence, was something rather like another Logrus with (or without)
another Courts of Chaos around it, an island in the roiling void. It
could either have come into existence or drifted close enough to our
reality to have rippling effects. When Corwin's pattern was drawn, it
could have provided an anchor point to stabilize the Courts-analogue.
Dammit, we need Corwin. <gods, I hate to say that. ;)>

I'm temporizing here, but the proximity of that kind of power base could
have *all* *kinds* of funky ripple effects. And could have without
calling attention to itself for quite some time.

There at least, we have the best source for research right in the room
with us. Except that I gather Ivy's the sorceror of that crowd; we'll
have to check with her later.

Grand. I'll add them to the list. You should listen in too, though, just
as I'll listen in when you talk with Clarissa and Titania, lest one of
us miss what the other would catch.

How odd. It retains your memory for you? I suppose it would be difficult
for you to say whether or not it knows anything you don't; you wouldn't
know where to start asking...but what, exactly, do you mean by

Probably, it means he was designed by someone with considerable
knowledge of the Pattern. Incorporating it into his design could give
him some interesting abilities within and across shadow, if it's done
right.

Additions to email convo, after time is reworked.  (Mark ask Dave, okay?)
 
Auricle:  Also, regarding Pearl, both Corwin and Cassandra seem rather
upset about it, but they can't discuss what's wrong here, as there are
too many people. This included Malachai, for some reason, although I
thought he was Corwin's son?
 
Rivka:  Well, Corwin acknowledged Malachai as his son.  On the other
hand, Random acknowledged Talos as his son, too.  Auricle, do you know
anything more about what they're upset about?
 
Auricle:  Just that they can't talk about it in front of so many people.
however, their level of concern is considerable greater than I have seen
in the past, even though I believe you said they were fighting a war.
So, logically, sometihng more dangerous than a war seems to be
threatening them, or Pearl, or both.
 
Rivka:  Sounds like the three of us should go to Pearl to see what's
going on.
 
Auricle:  But we're locked in this room.
 
Rivka:  Last time I went there, titania did it.  Mom might be able to get
around Oberon's little amusements, but I'm not sure about that.  shall we
go try?
 
Auricle:  Let's.

what questions you have and bring any matters to my father that would
require *his* attention.

Sorry, I shouldn't have assumed that one would have to walk Corwin's

Cassandra: Actually you are largely correct.  In order to cross the
barrier into Pearl you must have walked it's pattern or have made
arrangements with my father.  One can not just waltz in there.  And
should one attempt to do so, it might prove hazardous to one's
health.

Cassandra: Corwin hasn't *adopted* Malachai, he's recognised him.
Whether or not he can walk Pearl's Pattern is immaterial to that
relation.  His blood is not in question, it is Amber's, but I would
not have you risk my brother's life to prove your pet theory.
Perhaps one should begin with Amber's pattern and leave the walking
of Pearl's pattern to my family's concern.

Auricle:  But causitive factors may preceed the actual dispute and have
something to deal withthis unknown Paerl-opposite.

Auricle shrugs.  "Actually, my specialty isn't in formation gathering but
in synthesis of information.  I'm much better at putting data together in
understandable formats and coming up with conclusions and new theories
than actually doing research.  Rhi?  You seem to be better suited
actually gathering data...?"

Auricle:  In an attempt to make sense sof some of my own memories, I have
been studying the Amber pattern, albeit haphazardly.  Perhaps my own
