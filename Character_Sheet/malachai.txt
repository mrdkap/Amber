Why, exactly?

I apologize if I excluded you inappropriately from anything; the
situation moved very quickly and there wasn't much time to get anyone
involved. I need to get Trumps of the two of you sometime.
                                                                                
I am happy to give you a summary of what has happened. Essentially, Fiona
appears to have been taken over by Gwen. When Oberon attempted to walk
Corwin's Pattern, he called her in to help. Instead, she suggested
allowing him to die. Cowin knocked her unconscious, Trumped me and
Cassandra in, and Corwin drew enough power from him (dumping some into
me) to get Oberon off the Pattern. Fiona then woke up and attacked us; we
managed to escape with cover from Ingold. Corwin grabbed some allies and
went to rescue Ingold; I got Oberon out of Corwin's realm (which, in his
weakened state, appeared to be killing him).
 
Eventually, I got in touch with some elders, and we Trumped back to
Amber. Benedict organized a group effort in the library to Trump Fiona
and, if necessary, kill her. When we got through, Fiona had shifted into
Gwen and was fighting Corwin and friends. Some of us Trumped through,
including me. I borrowed Ben's pistol and shot her up a little before she
compensated with shields. We tried other things that didn't work.
Eventually, Dutchess Catherine of Jesby came through with some kind of
Logrus sword and cut her in half. I got injured pretty bad, but most of
us got Trumped back to Amber. Fiona is apparently OK, but shifted into a
child. Oberon is OK but off someplace else.

I'm sure that your planning is acceptable.

I'll keep that in mind.

I am happy for the company and am very interested in working with you and
Ivy to enhance the defenses of Arden. I'm interested in developing
artillery, land mines, and other applications of Avalon gunpowder. We set
up some routes from a few higher-tech shadows, where the stuff doesn't
work and they think we're idiots who pay well.
 
 
I am interested in getting practice with different sparring partners, and
would like to practice with you frequently if that's OK.
 
Cheers,
