Blink the rainbow function on and off a few times while he's looking. Pay
attention to his reaction. I'm looking for indications that he wants to talk
to me.
If that looks to be the case, t-port to the gate and go through in human
form, first turning myself invisible via sorcery then moving to a place out
of sight of the pair. There, turn myself visible again and approach them from
that direction and introduce myself to the lady and say hi to Merlin.
 
Just a reminder, I've named my character Osrick (using the correct spelling
of course), Ozzy to my friends. You may want to make me a member of a
prominant family in Chaos. In that case, give me a family name, otherwise,
send some good family name suggestions.
 
A note about Ozzy, in addition to everything else, he is unfazeable as per
the GURPS avantage. Also, the lizard form can breath fire, not much though,
just enough to intimidate and to light his cigar (expect more notes like this
as I develope the character).
 
Well, that's it for now. Let me know what happens.

   to me.
 
He seems to be nodding in time with the blinking and smiling right at the
gate, which, unless one was fringeworthy, would just be empty space.
 
   If that looks to be the case, t-port to the gate and go through in human
   form, first turning myself invisible via sorcery then moving to a place out
   of sight of the pair. There, turn myself visible again and approach them
from
   that direction and introduce myself to the lady and say hi to Merlin.
 
As you approach, Merlin jumps up and says "Ozzy!  I was hoping you would
show up!  I want to introduce you to my little sister."
 
Merlin continues with "Osrick, this is my sister Cassandra.  Cassandra,
this is my only childhood friend Osrick."
 
   You may want to make me a member of a
   prominant family in Chaos. In that case, give me a family name, otherwise,
   send some good family name suggestions.
 
I'll send it to you later (I have the family name that you used to be a
member of, but not handy, and you wouldn't have mentioned that to Merlin,
for then he might have then read into it some house alliance, and perhaps
your history, and maybe that you might actually not be as nutral as you
claimed to be.) I have even been working up a timeline.
 
   A note about Ozzy, in addition to everything else, he is unfazeable as per

   just enough to intimidate and to light his cigar (expect more notes like

Well, I don't quite know what the "as per the GURPS advantage" is, but,
well, before chaos was ripped by the first pattern being drawn, Osrick was
one of the procurers in the Sea of Chance, and, well you've probably seen
stranger things.  Not only that, but you have been trading in some of the
wierdest place for a while ... <Grin> you make more that way.  P.S. some
(actually quite a few in number, but not that many in percentage) of those
pocket stops are your storage facilities.

Cassandra curtsies sweetly "A pleasure to see you again... Osrick" (she is
trying to look and sound mature)

Cassandra smiles at Merlin's friend. "I know you... you're the egg

Cassandra curtsies sweetly "A pleasure to see you again... Osrick."
 
She has grown up nicely, and seems quite well mannered.
