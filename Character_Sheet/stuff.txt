Umm ... no.  Upper limit on goodstuff? 6 points.  Anything more than that,
and, well ... your goodstuff would keep you from running into the rest of
the PC's. <grin>  One of the jokers designed one that was real heavy on
goodstuff ... I had him start thinking of a secondary character, but he
instisted on trying it.  He ended up getting "shapeshift, confer" applied
on him, and he is now quite happy as a dolphin in the Sea of Thought, in
several connected shadows near Chaos that are one big philisophical brain.
He got so frustraited that no harm could come to him (and no action either)
that he quit the campaign.  Ahh well... no big loss.

-=> Oh.  My.  Dare I ask who presently has the most bad stuff (and what that
-=> bad stuff value is) in your present campaign?  It seems like 5 points of
-=> bad stuff would be... rather exciting.
 
The current worst bad-stuff character is standing in the garden, nipped out
of time.
 
The next one was hunted down and chased out of reach of this reality.
                                                                                     
Bad stuff is a real good way to get killed if you aren't careful.  Luck can
bite you HARD sometimes.

You lead the party?  The worst weather ever experienced in these parts.
Not a good, long-term plan.  Sometimes it is worth going into it, for
logical, well thought out, well, planned reasons ... but not always.
Anything more that 2 points of bad stuff, your character is going to be
sevearly warped by it.  He wouldn't have escaped by the luck of the demon
being distracted, he wouldn't have survived the inquisition ... putting
yourself in another's hands, and you pretty much loose, if you have more
than 2 points in bad stuff.
