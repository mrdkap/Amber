Scene: Tavern room.  Standard props for the tavern room, w/ the exception
of people.  Fire burning in the fire place.  Drinks placed on the table.
Table set for 6.  Bread, cheese and butter on the table a well.  Fairly
nice furnature, not too well padded, but not rough either.
                                                                                      
People: Orlando, Ivy, Jackie, Talos, sitting around and enjoying the
spread.  Rhiannon just entering the room alone.
                                                                                      
Items: Revann, Dharmedra, Amergin.
                                                                                      
Interactions: Jackie and Talos, talking.  Ivy slowly putting herself
together, Orlando casing the joint, Rhiannon, you know what just went on.

Now that Rikki is back on line, we can take a hack at trying this again ...
 
The address is tavern@haven.org for things to everyone.  It's easier that
way.
 
Below is the next...

now, since I'm back on line, did you want to ask Ivy anything?  I was still
sitting at the inn, and Rhiannon had returned without Zack, right?
 
-Riki/Ivy/Tetsuko/Charlotte's mommy
 
Right.  Scene again as a refresher:
 
Dishes serving themselves, Rhi - just entering the room, Orlando, Ivy,
Jackie, and Talos - relaxing in an otherwise empty dining room of what
appears to be a tavern.  No windows to the outside, and no natives seen.
Note to Orlando and Jackie, the guide that you had just began to trust had
said that he would be coming throught after the horses, and Rhi, the person
you were sent through to, just showed up without him.  This should probably
set off warning bells in your heads.
 
Tavern, Take 5 8-) (get it, the five of you, in a tavern ... never mind)
 
Your GM.

Prior to Ivy's involvement in the events of Scott's campaign, Ivy's most
recent
experience had been in circumstances where using a "detect poison" cantrip
would have been noticeable -- and therefore a breach of etiquette.  It's rude
to suggest that you suspect your host (or fellow guests?) of having it in for
you.  So if she had previously acquired the habit (and soemthing tells me she
*would* have, sometime in those 700 years), she'd have most recently dropped
it.
                                                                                      
So Ivy does NOT automatically run that cantrip over her food, thus failing to
provide an opportunity for Rhi to notice it and do something or nothing, or to
even have that bit of information.  A non-starter, basically.
                                                                                      
Ivy is tired, cold, and damp, and is just relieved at being out  from under
the
low-level magical gloomy rain that had dogged the party.  So she's not talking
much.

Ivy says nothing, but helps herself to whatever hot drink is nearest  --
spiced
wine, cider, tea, soup -- you get the impression she doesn't much care what it
is.  She sips it gratefully.

After she finishes about half of her drink, Ivy revives a little.
 
"The table service is a nice piece of work," she comments to Rhiannon.  "Who
set it up?"

Orlando, having iinstinctively posted himself in the most strategic chair in
the room, is abruptly on his feet about a quarter-second before a lithe figure
in red tunic and blue leggings -- someone you could mistake for Ivy in a
crowd,
but with shorter hair, bluish eyes and no points on the ears, and something a
little Redheadish in the features -- enters the room. As she's unarmed and
apparently not prepping a spell, Orlando turns his near-engarde into a more
courtly gesture so smoothly that you who know him best barely notice.
 
"Thank you for joining me, Ivy, Jackie, Talos and...would you prefer Roland or
Orlando?"
 
The comforting look is having the reverse effect on the big redhead. "Thank
you, Orlando will do nicely. And how may I have the honor of addressing you?"
 
She laughs gently. "I am Rhiannon, kind sir. And while I can understand a
certain discomfort around me -- I am Fiona's daughter, after all -- I'm not
sure I understand the double-blind you played with Mom. It's all right though,
she makes a lot of people uncomfortable." Her gaze widens to take the rest of
you in as well. "I'm afraid Zach won't be joining us for dinner. He got a
fairly urgent trump call, excused himself with the barest courtesy and was
off.
Your horses have been attended to, though...lovely animals. Zach always has
had
good taste in that respect.
                                                                                      
"I hope you find the food to your liking; I tried to think of everything, but
if there's something I've overlooked, don't stand on formality. Make
yourselves
comfortable. And thank you, Ivy, I'm glad the arrangements please you." She
punctuates this with a hundred-watt smile.

To: dkap@haven.org
 
 
Ivy noticed that Rhi didn't exactly answer her question.  Is there any flavor
of evasiveness in her words?  Do I get the feeling that she's lying or trying
to conceal that she didn't build the table service herself?  Or do I get the
feeling that she must have, and my initial impression of their not being her
work was mistaken?
 
Does she inspire trust the way Zach did?  Does she actively inspire distrust?
Ivy hates lacking full access to her box of clues...

He gives Jackie a vaguely amused brow-arch, and she realizes that what
she finds obvious in him is more subtle to others than she thinks --
this evidenced by Rhiannon's momentary confused look.
 
"Relax and enjoy your dinner," she smiles, apparently dismissing the odd
exchange. "When you've warmed yourselves a bit we can talk; I can't wait
to hear all about what must have been a fascinating trip."

Rhi, in the tavern, you notice that Ivy is casting some sort of spell.  It
looks like a very ornamental, fatigue banishing spell.  You can draw the
conclusion that she was taught via cookbook method, from this, for there
are many extraneous pieces that look like they were just included, since
this was the only way she knew how, otherwise she would have trimmed the
fat from it, especially if she was fatigued--
