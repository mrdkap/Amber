# Amber
The expanding Amberverse from dkap-amber

Greetings, and welcome to some of the on-line presence of my Amber
campaign.  Probably the best place to start is with the books, followed by
my <A HREF="divergent_point.html">divergent point</A> so you understand
where my campaign begins from.  Following that, you probably want to go to
dskern's extensive <A HREF="http://www.haven.org/~dskern/amber/">log
files</A> and the other <A HREF="logs/">log files</A> to find out what has
happened to date.  Also the <A HREF="https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/wiki">Wiki</A>
is a good place to find more updated materials.
