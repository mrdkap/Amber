# Amber
The expanding Amberverse from dkap-amber

Greetings, and welcome to some of the on-line presence of my Amber campaign.  Probably the best place to start is with the books, followed by my <A HREF="https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/blob/master/divertent_point.md">divergent point</A> so you understand where my campaign begins from.  Following that, you probably want to go to dskern's extensive <A HREF="http://www.haven.org/~dskern/amber/">log files</A> and the other <A HREF="logs/">log files</A> to find out what has happened to date.  Also the <A HREF="https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/wiki">Wiki</A> or the <A HREF="https://mrdkap.github.io/Amber/">IO Page</A> are good places to find more updated materials.
