Known to have walked the pattern, and has a tendency to work with Sorcery.  Often using his Signet Ring, with his personal symbol of a Sunburst (Yellow) with Unicorn in Silhouette (appearing Black), on a Green field. Unicorn rearing, facing to the right. (Vert unicorn Forcen√© sable supercharged sunburst or) 
 
Alistair was the one that Bleys was in trump contact with during the Kolvir incident, and was the one passing him knives along the way.
 
Fiona was his pattern tutor.
 
Fiona is satisfied, barely, with his Psyche development.  Though they get along, she thinks that Alistair is a bit lazy when it comes to development of his Psyche, and the "arts" driven by it.  She also fervently wishes he would get out and exercise more, and hard.  Amber Endurance is all very well, against mundanes, but against a serious opponent...  Bleys agrees on the Endurance score, but is fairly pleased with Alistair's Strategy, Tactics, and Skill at Arms.
 
During the Confrontation at Chaos, Alistair was acknowleged by Bleys, and was leading his troops during the conflict.
 
He spent most of his childhood in Tarmac, A very militaristic shadow where Bleys is the Commander in Chief over both empires (the Trundy and the Moix) who are consistantly at war with each other.  When Alistair was old enough, (200 personal time) Bleys retired from CiC in his favor on the Trundy side, (of course continuing on the Moix side) to give Alistair his final polish as a military leader.
 
Tarmac is an enigma.  Damper technology can prevent the chemical reactions that cause chemical firearms to work.  They can also prevent the detonation of nuclear weapons.  But they present an interesting conundrum.  They are unselective, area defenses.  The trick is to tune them to *only* affect the desired reaction.  Dampers *could* be tuned to stop the chemical reactions that support human life.  Then they could be used as the equivalent of a Neutron Bomb.  Also, they cannot stop __electricity__, because they must themselves run on electricity.  Technology is rapidly approaching the level where MLA (Magnetic Linear Accelerator) weapons will be developed.  Dampers will not be able to stop them.  Gauss rifles as sidearms and Mass Drivers as Artillery/AntiArmor/AntiAircraft weapons will appear, throwing the Shadow into, pardon the expression, chaos.  Also, shortly on their heels, laser weapons will begin to appear.  Those that rely on CLCs (Chemical Laser Cartridges) will be dampable, but DEI (Direct Electrical Input) Lasers will not.  This is beginning to worry Alistair, and he means to take it up with Bleys ASAP.

Also, to appear in his "Trundy" form, that of General Count Dax Krieger, and to distinguish that form from that of Alistair, known to both sides, I assume he employs a disguise spell.
 
To use Earth analogy, Trundy are more German-like and that the Moix are more French-like.
 
A Note: Natives of Tarmac live about 100 years total.  One of the (many) reasons that Bleys could gain control...
 
Alistair wasn't directly involved in the Redhead Conspiracy, mostly because Bleys didn't trust Brand.
 
And, Alistair didn't really like Brand.  Also, Alistair is not suited to conspiracies.  Managing the fiction of the Trundy vs. Moix conflict is about as complex as he has the stomach for.  Fiona probably would have urged Bleys to keep Alistair out of it on that basis as well.
 
Finally, given that Alistair is about 525 years old, subjective, and grew up in a Shadow designed (it seems) to expose him to a great deal of variety, he was someone with quite a wide range of "mundane" skills.
