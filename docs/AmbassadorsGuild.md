The Ambassadors [Guild](ChaosGuilds#ambassadors) is known for being outreach for [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) and often it's current [King](KingOfChaos).

Possibly the only reason, initially, that might making right was not the only order of the day, Rose has a fasination with diversity, and cultures not her own.  Rose, Branier, and the rest of their guild have spent lifetimes building bridges, working out treaties, and throwing parties with the help of the [Dancers](DancersGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds).

Knowing and learning the forms of new cultures drives the members of this guild to achieve great things.
