## Amelia Johnson

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Curator at the New York Historical Society, Amelia has been known to do
the lecture circuit from time to time.  Hobbyist folks are also aware
of her amazing historical scene and battle recreations that she has
given tours of, while on said circuit from time to time. She has an
eye to being able to pull out quite subtle details from minimal clues,
and connect things that others might not have seen.

While she sometimes tours with fellow curator Beth, who has a knack
for tech, she does credit her friend Jenny with help on the
recreations, but apparently Jenny is a recluse, for she is never
introduced during the lecture tours, or to anyone in the museum.
