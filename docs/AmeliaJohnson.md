## Amelia Johnson

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Amelia is just really average looking.  She has long wavy brown hair
and dark brown eyes.  She is average height (5'8" maybe?).  She has an
hourglass figure, but is otherwise pretty slim.  She tends to wear
earth tones (brown, beige, green, blue), most often wearing a blouse,
jacket, pants, and heels.  There's nothing really remarkable about her
looks.

Curator at the New York Historical Society, Amelia has been known to do
the lecture circuit from time to time.  Hobbyist folks are also aware
of her amazing historical scene and battle recreations that she has
given tours of, while on said circuit from time to time. She has an
eye to being able to pull out quite subtle details from minimal clues,
and connect things that others might not have seen.

While she sometimes tours with fellow curator Beth, who has a knack
for tech, she does credit her friend [Jenny](JennyJohnson) with help on
the recreations, but apparently Jenny is a recluse, for she is never
introduced during the lecture tours, or to anyone in the museum.
