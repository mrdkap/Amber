## Arial "Karma" Li

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Current leader of the [Epsilon Team](DrashirStrikeTeams).


Arial almost refused to answer to her call sign. The fact that her
utterly resilient ass was always able to endure whatever deathtrap she
found herself in, as well as her mind like a steel trap and penchant
for the settling of debts seemed to her to be mostly happenstance. But
she found herself contacting [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) more and more
often for the information and the edge to balance the scale of the
week. After one such incursion, she complained about the occasional
negativity she got from teammates and superiors alike for her
passionate exploits. [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) suggested that maybe it
was time to embrace the mantle and all the fear that came with
invoking its name. Since then, Karma has worked hard to not just be a
bitch, but "The Bitch". And she uses Epsilon to avenge in
[Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s name ... as well as her own.
