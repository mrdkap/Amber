The Assassin's [Guild](ChaosGuilds#assassins) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) is led by [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins).

The guild can be contracted to kill targets, fees negotiable by the Guild.  The Guild sets its own fee structure and makes its own decisions about whether to accept or reject targets. Guild members are sticklers for making sure there is a witness to the assassination to sign a receipt.

Guild contracts are available for viewing at the Guild itself, but there is wide speculation that if the subject to a contract arrives at the Guild, they would be shown their contract and then killed.

The order of the Sith are a cadet branch of the Assassins Guild, and share their fondness for black uniforms.

[Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) is a member of the Assassin's Guild, and was [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins)'s apprentice for a time.

The Guild is currently undergoing some structural issues, after [Llewella](LlewellaOfOberon) abducted most of the physical guild.
