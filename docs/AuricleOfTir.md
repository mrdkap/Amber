She looks something like <A HREF="http://codollaeytharis.deviantart.com/art/Auricle-of-Amber-60546867">this</A>

"Auricle & [Zack](ZachariasOfJulian): Private Investigators. 'No Amber Too Big, No Amber Too Small' (Vivisections at no extra cost)"

[Pattern](PrimalPattern) Master, now that [Neville](NevilleOfEric) is no more.

Current Regent in [Amber](KolvirPromontory) because King [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) is ... unavailable for the nonce.



Auricle had no idea she was an Amberite, living life in multiple but similar Shadows conducting her mad experiments and being worshipped as a Goddess. A bunch of angel statues with sunglasses showed up and starting taking over, thus starting her on a statue-smashing career that landed her in a cage in Gwen's lab. Escaping that proved easy for her, but not for her Gargoyle, so she took the cage with her and starting shifting through Shadow until she found people who could get the cage off her Gargoyle - which led her to Amber. She was part of the group that killed Gwen one of the times, and she is adamant on anti-Gwen measures regardless of if she's really dead this time or not.

She's generally considered an Amberite, but no one has any proof of that other than her strange affinity for the Pattern (one can't say she walks it). She doesn't seem to be the child of the Elder Generation, trumping missing Amberites doesn't get to her, and she's got absolutely no memory of anything beyond waking up in Shadow with her Gargoyle. (Well, mostly no memory.) Theories have ranged from Dworkin's kid to the Unicorn's to the Pattern itself.  Making things more complicated, in the original Pattern-verse her affinity was stronger for Tir's Pattern instead of Amber or the Primal Pattern, hence she goes by Auricle of Tir. 

The two people she considers her closest friends are Zack and Jean.
