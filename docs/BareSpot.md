A relatively static and unchanging area in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) near the edge of the [Abyss](TheAbyss), where the landscape doesn't try to eat you and buildings tend to stay where you put them.  This was caused by a traumatic event, and was left, as it was, by the [Gardener](RealmsMasterShiryu), as an object lesson to remind people not to let their squabbles escalate to a level that they would affect the promontory.  

Apparently this is also an itchy spot that [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) has to scratch every now and again.
