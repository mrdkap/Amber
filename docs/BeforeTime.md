## The Before Time
 + Waves of primal chaos wash from the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) across the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) (otherwise known as the body of the [Serpent of Chaos](SerpentOfChaos).  Various things reset.
 + [Old Lords](OldLord) re-emerging from the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) set up a structure of [Houses](ChaosHouses) and [Guilds](ChaosGuilds) creating what is now known as the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), sometimes known as "The Courts" or "Chaos".
 + [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) arrives relatively early; [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) (in an alternate universe) later says that she predates him.
 + [Dworkin Barimen](DworkinOfAmber) is the Guildmaster of the [Crafters Guild](ChaosGuilds#crafters).
    + At some point, [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) (normally male and a shapeshifter) and the [Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber) (also male and ''not'' a shapeshifter) father [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
 + The [Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber) and the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) fight, and after the Serpent loses an eye it's **really** not fun and games.
## Dworkin Draws the Pattern
 + [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) travels to the [Primal Amber](PrimalAmber)/[Kolvir Promontory](KolvirPromontory) and draws the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern), creating [Shadow](ShadowPlaces).
    + The act of drawing the pattern drives [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) insane, a state he will remain in for millenia. It is rumored that this mental state was, possibly deliberately, created by his son [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
    + The [Pattern](PrimalPattern) creates [Shadow](ShadowPlaces) out of formlessness, linking [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory) and the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos). The material that is [Shadow](ShadowPlaces) also traps other, mostly unrelated, promontories in place in the 'local' universe.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) founds the Kingdom of [Amber](KolvirPromontory).
    + Castle Amber is deliberately built without bathrooms. Later, [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) children will deal with the lack of bathrooms in their own ways.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) marries [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen), and has [Osric](OsricOfOberon), [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon), and [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) with her.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) finds a fault with his marriage with [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen), and has it dissolved "ab initio" after [Eric](EricOfOberon) walks the [Pattern](KolvirPattern).  [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma) gives birth to [Eric](EricOfOberon) (before his previous marriage is dissolved), [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), and [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon).  [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma) dies in childbirth with [Deirdre](DierdreOfOberon).
 + While married to [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) has [Caine](CaineOfOberon) with [Rilga](RilgaQueenOfTremere) during his affair with her.
 + [Osric](OsricOfOberon) and [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon) die "For the Good of Amber". (Possibly while [traying down Mount Kolvir](TrayingIncident) and keeping Oberon awake, but probably not.)
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) marries [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover), and they have [Fiona](FionaOfOberon), [Bleys](BleysOfOberon), and [Brand](BrandOfOberon).  [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) leaves [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) while pregnant with [Mikail](MikailOfOberon), and raises [Mikail](MikailOfOberon) without [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) knowledge.
    + During a rough patch in the marriage, [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) has an affair wiht [Queen Moins of Rebma](MoinsOfRebma) that leads to [Llewella's](LlewellaOfOberon) birth.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) is blood cursed at least once; after this, when he bleeds [Amber's](KolvirPromontory) moon collects blood.
 + [Caine](CaineOfOberon) and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) take turns running the underworld of [Amber](KolvirPromontory) as the Left Hand and the Right Hand
 + [Amber City](KolvirPromontory) is burned down a few times and rebuilt by its inhabitants.
 + [Tazik](TazikTheSwordmaker)'s great-great-grandfather makes [Greyswandir](PatternBlade) for [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon)
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Rilga](RilgaQueenOfTremere) have two more sons, [Julian](JulianOfOberon) and [Gerard](GerardOfOberon), this time while legitimately married.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Dybele](DybeleOfDancers) have a daughter, [Florimel](FlorimelOfOberon) ("Flora"), during their marriage.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) meets [Damiana](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana), who is searching [shadow](ShadowPlaces) for her sister [Paulette](CobalteanRoyalFamily#paulette).  Language difficulties and the intershadow language of love lead to [Damiana](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana) becoming "Queen Paulette", and giving birth to [Random](RandomOfOberon) and [Mirelle](MirelleOfOberon).
 + [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) last wife, ["Paulette"](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana), apparently dies.  Soon after, his youngest daughter [Mirelle](MirelleOfOberon) dies on the [Pattern](KolvirPattern).
    + According to [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict), [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) starts his decline.
 + According to a later "Brand" (possibly of Faerie), [Brand](BrandOfOberon) apprentices himself to [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), giving her some control over him.  According to [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys), this control includes emotions and memories, and directly leads to the events of [Pattern Fall](PatternFall).
 + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) fights and woos [Lintra of House Hendrake](LintraOfHendrake).  Lintra is killed, but gives birth to [Triumph](TriumphOfBenedict) before then.  [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) loses a large portion of his left arm.
 + After [Brand](BrandOfOberon) goes insane after walking [the Logrus](TheLogrus), [Borel](BorelOfHendrake) is elected [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos).  Soon after, the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos) declares war on [Amber](KolvirPromontory) leading to the events of [Pattern Fall](PatternFall).
