[Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) describing Benedict:

> Then there was Benedict, tall and dour, thin, thin of body, thin
of face, wide of mind. He wore orange and yellow and brown and
reminded me of haystacks and pumpkins and scarecrows and the
__Legend of Sleepy Hollow__. He had a long strong jaw and hazel
eyes and brown hair that never curled. He stood beside a tan horse
and leaned upon a lance about which was twined a rope of
flowers. He seldom laughed. I liked him.

Great-Great-Grandfather of:
 + [Absalom](AbsalomOfGil) - by [Gil](GilOfJanus)

The master tactician of the family as well as the unmatched master of all martial weapons, and a man who seldom smiles. He chose to remove himself from the struggle for the crown, leaving [Eric](EricOfOberon) and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) as the eldest surviving heirs. Moreover, [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) declared his marriage with [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen) null and void, (ab-initio) rendering all his children by her retroactively illegitimate. Benedict has had an affair with [Lintra the Hellmaid of Chaos](LintraOfHendrake), during a brief interlude in hostilities between them, and was unaware that she bore a child as a result of this. Benedict and [Lintra](LintraOfHendrake) subsequently came to blows again, and Benedict slew Lintra but lost his arm. He still fights better with one arm than anybody else with two, and often, so does his replacement arm, without Benedict attached.

Spent some time dealing as head of the [Chaosian](CourtsOfChaos) [Warrior's](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds), due to having slain the previous title holder.  This is an excerpt of a conversaton between Benedict and [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin):

> Benedict: "Yes. Perhaps soon. I am told that I am considered head of the Warrior's Guild in Chaos, and I would like to take over my post there."
> Malachai: "How did that happen?"
> Benedict: "I killed the previous head of the guild during the war."

Killed and vivisected by an [alternate Benedict](EvilBenedict) from the [Evil-Verse](EvilAmber), then sealed in blucite, removed and rebuilt, then lost and found once again, and now doing the Family Thing. The [evil alternate Benedict](EvilBenedict) has apparently converted to righeousness, and was helping [Hamster Dworkin](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#dworkin) convert [Julian](JulianOfOberon).
