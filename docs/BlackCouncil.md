A coalition of dragonish Wyrms who are rebelling against the Wyrmish social order.  It is speculated that these were dragons who were forced to become Wyrms, and found a way out of it.

The Black Council attacked [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) at the [Assassins Guild](ChaosGuilds#assassins), killing many [Dragons](WhoIsWhereDragons) and [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites).  They have also killed several Wyrms supporting [promontories](Cosmology) not attached to the local universe, and injured the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) - causing the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).
