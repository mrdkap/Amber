"... a big, corpse-colored guy with red hair and a horse to match. He wore coppery armor with greenish tracings, and he sat facing me, still as a statue." - *Courts of Chaos*

Duke Borel was the guild second of the [Warriors](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds#warriors) and the head of [House Hendrake](HouseHendrake), an exception to the [Chaosian](CourtsOfChaos) tradition to separate powers between the [houses](ChaosHouses) and the [guilds](ChaosGuilds). Borel trained [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict) in swordplay.

Duke Borel was elected [King](KingOfChaos) and declared war against [Amber](ShadowKolvir). [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) killed him during the final battle of [Pattern Fall](PatternFall).
