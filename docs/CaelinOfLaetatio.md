## Caelin
> (And Cailin was involved and things got worse...)

Caelin, son of [Laetatio](LaetatioOfRandom) and Circe of [EarthSea].

Caelin is the head of [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight), a Chaosian house created in
a fit of pique by his grandmother Princess Chandra when another
Chaosian house lay claim to her descendants.

Most notably, Caelin is one of the most powerful mages in existence.
Caelin's magical power is often measured by how many multiples of
the entire magical potential of Shadow he has contained inside him.

Caelin's beloved is [Natasha of Cobalt](CobalteanRoyalFamily#natasha).

Caelin has secretly acted as [Zorro's](ZorroOfAssassins) apprentice/sidekick.

Caelin is a shapeshifter in that he has one alternate form, a Yeti
whose primary skill is running extremely quickly away from danger.

Caelin is one of two known player characters with a Warfare rank
below Human; the other is [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) but Caelin's "music nerd"
rank is higher than Jean's "five year old" rank.

## The Archivist

An alternate Caelin from another reality is known as "The Archivist".
The Archivist is a master of Bibliomancy.

The Archivist is House Second of Houe Moonlight.
