Caelin, son of [Laetatio](LaetatioOfRandom) and Circe of [EarthSea].

Caelin is the head of [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight), a Chaosian house created in
a fit of pique by his grandmother Princess Chandra when another
Chaosian house lay claim to her descendants.

Most notably, Caelin is one of the most powerful mages in existence.
Caelin's magical power is often measured by how many multiples of
the entire magical potential of Shadow he has contained inside him.

Caelin's beloved is [Natasha of Cobalt](CobalteanRoyalFamily#natasha).

Caelin has secretly acted as [Zorro's](ZorroOfAssassins) apprentice/sidekick.

Caelin is one of two known player characters with a Warfare rank
below Human; the other is [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) but Caelin's "music nerd"
rank is higher than Jean's "five year old" rank.
