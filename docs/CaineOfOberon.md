>"Then came the swarthy, dark-eyed countenance of Caine, dressed all in satin that was black and green, wearing a dark three-cornered hat set at a rakish angle, a green plume of feathers trailing down the back.  He was standing in profile, one arm akimbo, and the toes of his boots curled upwards, and he wore an emerald-studded dagger at his belt."

Son of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Rilga](RilgaQueenOfTremere), full brother to [Julian](JulianOfOberon) and [Gerard](GerardOfOberon).

Caine faked his own death during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall), and attempted to kill [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon).  He did kill [Brand](BrandOfOberon) at the end of the war.

Postwar, [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) eventually appointed Caine the guild second of the [Warriors](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds) when [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) was missing. Caine was briefly [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos) until he angered [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) and was dethroned.  This triggered a chain of events that led to Caine destroying an alternate [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), angering the [Winged Wyrm](WingedWyrm), and being killed and scaled with extreme prejudice.

Owns (owned?) a [Logrus Blade](LogrusBlade) named "Shoals".

There is rumor that there might have been another child or two either after [K'rin](KrinOfCaine) died, or (unlikely) that she missed in her fratricidal obsession.  But none that have been officially recognized as far as anyone knows, and now, that Caine is dead, unlikely to be so.

Father of:
 + [K'rin](KrinOfCaine): Acknowledged by Caine (at least to her, and to Tremere) from the beginning. Fratricide - of anyone Caine might have slept with that was not her mother.
 + [Raven](RavenOfCaine): Born to [K'rin](KrinOfCaine)'s nanny, while [K'rin](KrinOfCaine) was quite young. Not known to be her sibling, thought to be her lover and companion, until after her death.
 
Ancestor of:
 + [Ferenc Nadasdy](FerencNadasdyOfRaven)
 + [Paul](PaulOfFerenc)
