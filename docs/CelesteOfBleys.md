After [Pattern Fall](PatternFall), Celeste either rescued or recreated [Brand](BrandOfOberon) from [Faerie](TitaniaOfFaerie). It is rumored that this is the first instances of someone being pulled back from the [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement).

Celeste unintentionally became the [Trump Unabomber](SpiralExplosion), and was responsible for [Merlin's](MerlinOfCorwin) death on the [Spiral](TheSpiral) by trumping him through his block and distracting him in the middle of a ritual to purge [Toram](ToramOfMages) from [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters). The resulting catacylsm killed several members of the [Cobaltean](CobaltPromontory) [Royal Family](CobalteanRoyalFamily), duplicated [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) (and [Greyswandir](PatternBlade), and [Dworkin's](DworkinOfAmber) [trump deck](TrumpDeck)), and infected the [Spiral](TheSpiral) with [Toram](ToramOfMages).

Celeste died with [Brand](BrandOfOberon), defending [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory) from a [Chaosian](CourtsOfChaos) suicide mission led by [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins).
