Cemen is an [Old Lord](OldLord) of the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos) who has the power of Unmaking.  He appears to have been created with this power and so doesn't have any other combat skills or defensive instincts; the concept of 'running away' was novel to him.

With [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins), Cemen is the parent of [WarlordMarial](Marial). Cemen spent a while in the form of a destructive sandstorm in self-imposed exile as a way to stop Unmaking things.  There is some indication [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) used this sandstorm as a disposal mechanism.

[Count Cagliostro](CountCagliostro) is trying to babysit Cemen into learning how not to instinctively Unmake anything he finds threatening.

The players don't currently understand how unmaking works except that:
1. The thing Cemen concentrates on goes Away (wished into the cornfield)
2. As objects go away, '[Antidragons](AntiDragons)' are created that will also destroy other things
3. Concentrating on antidragons makes them more powerful, so researching them is dangerous
