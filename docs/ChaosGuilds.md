## <a name="major"></a>17 Major Guilds of the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos)
 1. <a name="ambassadors"></a>[Ambassadors](AmbassadorsGuild) Guild - Guildmistress Rose [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Branier (missing after [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge)). Very similar to the Etiquette Guild but for those from not [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).
 1. <a name="assassins"></a>[Assassins](AssassinsGuild) Guild - Guildmistress [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Tirellian.
 1. <a name="bards"></a>Bards Guild - Princess Harp [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Leareth.  Historians, storytellers, entertainers.  Often hired by the [Dancers Guild](DancersGuild) and the [Ambassadors Guild](AmbassadorsGuild).
 1. <a name="beastmasters"></a>[Beastmasters](BeastmastersGuild) Guild - Guildmaster [Snarscht](SnarshtOfBeastmasters) [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Trinock (demon).  The guild has been misplaced after the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).
 1. <a name="crafters"></a>Crafters Guild - Guildmaster Qrelon [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Morganthe.  The guild staff are almost precisely identical massive cubes. The reason for this is unknown. As far as anyone knows, [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) has never taken that shape.
 1. <a name="dancers"></a>[Dancers](DancersGuild) Guild - Guildmaster [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), Guild second [Silver Lyra](SilverLyra).
 1. <a name="etiquette"></a>[Etiquette](EtiquetteGuild) Guild - Very similar to the [Ambassadors Guild](AmbassadorsGuild), except focused on all the beings in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  Currently held in a pocket stop on the [Fringe](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) by [King](KingOfChaos) [Osric](OsricOfChannicut), because the are widely being impersonated.
 1. <a name="healers"></a>[Healers](HealersGuild) Guild - A guild of long history, helping and healing bodies and minds that have become broken.  They believe in restoration, not crafting anew, but have been known to smooth over some bumps when necessary.  Due to actions of the Poisoners Guild, was newly re-founded and re-formed, under [Snarsht's](SnarshtOfBeastmasters) supervision.
 1. <a name="herbalists"></a>Herbalists Guild - Guildmaster Cress, guild second Alexia Much to their suprise, recently promoted into the place of the Poisoners Guild, due to politics, and bad choices on the Poisoners Guild members part.
 1. <a name="mages"></a>[Mages](MagesGuild) Guild - Guildmistress [Amaranth](AmaranthOfFlorimel), guild second the [Bear Mage](BearMage) [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  Rebuilding, and reconnecting to their roots.
 1. <a name="mathematicians"></a>Mathematicians Guild - Guildmaster Gauss [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), guild second Teague.  For more information see the power [Mathematics](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).
 1. <a name="philosophers"></a>[Philosophers](PhilosophersGuild) Guild - Guildmaster [Sea of Thought](SeaOfThought), guild second Eudiche. A backbone of understanding beyond the reasoning of most, and a level of patience beyond even that.
 1. <a name="psionicists"></a>[Psionicists](PsionicistsGuild) Guild - Guildmistress Miryam, Guild second Lothien. They are in the midst of adjusting the guild to their new patterns.
 1. <a name="rimfishers"></a>Rimfishers Guild - Guildmaster Bochor [Old Lord](OldLord), Guild Second [Osric](OsricOfChanicut) [Old Lord](OldLord). Now a major guild again after the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge), because [rim-fishing](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) is the way to get stuff again, due to the whole "Lack of the [Abyss](TheAbyss)" circumstances, so [pit diving](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) is no longer an option.
 1. <a name="shifters"></a>Shifters Guild - heavily restructuring after suffering the wrath of [Cyndia](CobalteanRoyalFamily#cyndia).  Secretly run by [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) pretending to be the old guild head, [Riscorian](RiscorianOfShifters). Guild second Wyndham.
 1. <a name="torturers"></a>Torturers Guild - technically empty, one false member.  Not formally demoted.  Only one actual member survives, Lord Talos, but he is on [Corwin's Promontory](CorwinPromontory) and his location is not known to the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos). Apparently it's not in your best interest to piss off certain [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites) in combination with certain members of the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).
 1. <a name="warriors"></a>[Warriors](WarriorsGuild) Guild - Guildmistress [Cyndia](CobalteanRoyalFamily#cyndia), after much turnover.  Guild second [Raven](RavenOfCaine). Both by inheritance, although this is not commonly known.

Tirellian, Dalmas, and Wyndham are sisters, and often are mistaken for triplets, or each-other.

## <a name="minor"></a>Minor Guilds of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos)
 + <a name="concubines"></a>Concubines Guild - subsidiary/spinoff guild of the [Dancers Guild](DancersGuild). Guildmistress Aphrodisia, guild second Mark. (It is rumored they are married, and fight a lot.)

## <a name="defunct"><a>Defunct or Missing Guilds of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos)
 + <a name="poisoners"></a>Poisoners Guild - [Bronelle](BronelleOfPoisoners) was Guildmistress, with Dalmas as guild second.
 + <a name="slavers"></a>Slavers Guild - [Mikail](MikailOfOberon) put in a bid to be Guildmaster, perhaps unknowingly. One of the cross-shadow branches was run by [Raven](RavenOfCaine) and [K'rin](KrinOfCaine).
 + <a name="pitdivers"></a>Pit Divers Guild - Traders with the Demon Houses on the walls of the [Abyss](TheAbyss) as well as diving deep into it to get things not common, or not sought after by the Demons House members.  Now that the [Abyss](TheAbyss) is no more, the guild (and their guild-house) are defunct and gone.
