## <A NAME="information">House Information</A>
There are exactly seventeen major houses in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) (that make up the Council of Houses), and some large number of minor houses.  When necessary, the Council of Houses elect the [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos). The King does not need to be a house member or even a Chaosian, although tradition does tend to go that way.  More often than not, it is someone ranked in a [Guild](ChaosGuilds), who has renounced House membership who is elected, so as to not give any one House more power.

At [Realms Master Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu)'s request, each House (major, minor or demon) has a House Head and a House Second, and each have rings to mark their position.  All other house titles are up to the House.

By convention, the head of a House is referred to by the House's name.  For example, when REN was head of [House Cara](HouseCara), he became known as "Cara" until he stepped down again.  If someone has been a house head for a long time, their personal name may not be known at all.

In the Council of Houses, votes are tallied as follows:
1. The lowest-ranked house votes first, and on up
1. The lowest ranked house gets one vote, the next highest house gets two votes, up to the first house which gets seventeen votes
1. The tallies are public, and sometimes takes quite a number of turnings, so having the record, in case there is a recess, is important.

Because of house alliances (or sucking up) it's common for a house to assigns its vote to a later one (eg. "Cara votes with House Pharaban")

## <A NAME="major">Relative house standings</A> is probably determined by the [Etiquette Guild](ChaosGuilds)
