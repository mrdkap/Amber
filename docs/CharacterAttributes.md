## Character Attributes

### Psyche
	This is the rating of the character's mental strength.  Psyche
    also shows the character's force of will, and their agility in
    manipulating any of the [powers](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).  In
    addition a character with a high psyche will be sensitive to
    danger and to other things.
	
	Most important, the relative rankings in psyche will determine all
    contests of the mind.  These psychic battles often fought through
    one [power](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) or another, or even by
    touch, will be always judged by a character's psyche.  The loser
	in a psychic battle can, if overwhelmed, be killed by the power of
	the mind alone.
	
	Why bid on Psyche?  Mental power, no matter what your power base,
    is the battery that runs things.  Whatever of the 
	[powers](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) you have, it is the character
    with the highest rank in psyche who will be most feared or
    respected.

### Strength
	Strength rates the character's muscles, and therefore the damage
    that a character can inflict in hand to hand combat, as well as
    the character's resistance to damage.
	
	Once characters lay hands on each other, or those that would oppose
    them, the contest, no matter what it might have been before,
    becomes one of sheer strength.  Unlike other form of combat, where
    a character can usually run away, there is likely no escape from a
    wrestling match with a character of superior strength.
	
	Why bid on Strength? If there is any such thing as a "sure thing"
    it is having a superior ranking in strength.  Most combat can go
    either way, influence by any number of factors, but once you've
    got your hands around your enemy's throat, all that counts is
    strength.

### Endurance
	When normal mortals tire after a few minutes of fierce combat,
    ranked individuals can keep fighting, fencing, or partying for
    much longer.  In addition, ranked endurance includes the ability
    to heal wounds rapidly, even to the extent of (eventually)
    regenerating lost limbs and organs.  In a fight of any kind,
    whether warfare, strength, or psyche, the character with the
    greatest endurance always has a chance of holding out longer than
    any opponent with lesser endurance, and winning by default.
	
	Endurance is the only attribute that comes into play in every
    situation involving either physical combat or the use of 
	[arcane powers](PowersBalancesAndOpposites). 
	
	Why bid on Endurance?  Frankly, you need it for everything.  And,
    even if you are somewhat inferior in some battle, a higher rank in
    endurance, combined with a little patience, virtually guarantees
    victory.  Endurance is the ultimate tie-breaker.
	
### Warfare
	Not all folks are trained in warfare, but anyone who is the use of
    any weapons from daggers to machine guns, requires warfare to
    operate skillfully.  Strategy games (including power-brokering in
    companies, and actual, on the field tactics) are all judged
    according to the relative warfare of the participants.
	
	Weakness in warfare is more dangerous than in any other
    attribute.  That's because the relative rank in warfare determines
    how long the combat will last.  If the rank is too low, the
    character can be hurt or killed before even having a chance to
    flee, much less realize that they are engaged in combat, or might
    be at risk of their life.
	
	Why bid on Warfare?  Face it, most conflict boils down to
    warfare.  There's nothing faster, nothing more
    decisive. [Power](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) usage and finesse are
    determined by warfare, just as the flash of the blade is.  A mark
    of a respected character is one who uses both skillfully.
