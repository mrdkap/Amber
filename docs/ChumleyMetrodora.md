## Chumley Metrodora

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Chumley is a big guy easily 6’4” and built like a linebacker. Looking
at him, you question if he will open a door, or just walk through it.
He has long black hair, he keeps in a ponytail, a well-groomed Beard,
and Mustache.  He wears glasses, that seem to change with his mood,
and needs.  While he will dress for occasions, he is most comfortable
in boots, jeans, t-shirt, and hoodie.  And almost always has a shoulder
bag or backpack.

A quiet geeky sort, who is just as happy to play with numbers and
fibers as he is to play in a machine shop with wood and metal.  While
he enjoys traveling, he is just as happy to haunt the local
establishments closer to home.  While not much is known about
Chumley’s history, he is rumored to have taken on many jobs and
hobbies, including fireworks, stick fighting, Digital Imagery,
Emergency Field Medicine, and Security.

Considers a Sledgehammer to be his spirit animal.
