## Chumley Metrodora

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

A quiet geeky sort, who is just as happy to play with numbers and
fibers as he is to play in a machine shop with wood and metal.  While
he enjoys traveling, he is just as happy to haunt the local
establishments closer to home.  While not much is known about
Chumleyâ€™s history, he is rumored to have taken on many jobs and
hobbies, including fireworks, stick fighting, Digital Imagery,
Emergency Field Medicine, and Security.

Considers a Sledgehammer to be his spirit animal.
