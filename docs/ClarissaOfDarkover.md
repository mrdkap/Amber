A red-head from the "Far southern shadows", once wife to [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and his Queen in [Amber](ShadowKolvir), working her way up from [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) through [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) eventually to [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) himself.  Then, as a sanity check, back down to [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) again.  One-time ruler of [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory) via the Overworld, mistress of [The Matrix/Life Magic](PowersBalancesAndOpposites). Clarissa was the opposite and enemy of [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie).

She is the mother to the [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberite) [Rivka](RivkaOfBenedict) and [Alhaserus](AlhaserusOfBenedict) with [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon).  Then, working her way upstream, had [Fiona](FionaOfOberon), [Bleys](BleysOfOberon), and [Brand](BrandOfOberon) with [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).  She then continued up the inheritance waterfall, and had [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) with [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber).  This was quite the disturbing interlude, so, as a sanity check on herself, had [Mikail](MikailOfOberon) via [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) again.  She also contributed quite a bit to the countless non-Amberite redheads, due to being so fecund.  The only members of the [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and Clarissa line known to survive are [Felice](FeliceOfCeleste) and [Faythe](FaytheOfCeleste) (who is the current mistress of [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory)).

Oh, and her son [Mikail](MikailOfOberon) **HATES** her, to depths and breadths that most people cannot understand.

A secret (or not so secret, depending) ally of [Toram](ToramOfMages) and [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), although considered an ally by the PCs for some time.  Pronounced a traitor to reality by [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu), and unmade, after draining the life, skills, and power out of all of those of her line that she could reach and pull from, during an attack on [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory).
