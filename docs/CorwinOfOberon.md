Corwin is the narrator of the first series of Amber books. He is the son of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Faeilla](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), the younger full brother of [Eric](EricOfOberon) and older full brother of [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon).  He was amnesiac and exiled to Shadow Earth for four hundred local years (over 100 Amber years).  Corwin's curse was responsible for the Black Road being able to reach the Vale of Garnath in [Amber](KolvirPromontory) during the "[Pattern Fall War](PatternFall)."

> I knew the me I shaved and this was the guy behind the mirror. Green eyes, black hair, dressed in black and silver, yes. I had on a cloak and it was slightly furled as by a wind. I had on black boots, like Eric's, and I too wore a blade, only mine was heavier, though not quite as long as his. I had my gloves on and they were silver and scaled. The clasp at my neck was cast in the form of a silver rose.

Corwin drew a new Pattern and founded the [realm of Pearl](CorwinPromontory); he has withdrawn there.  Pearl is no longer directly connected through Shadow to the main Amber and Chaos.  Pearl is defined to exclude [Logrus](TheLogrus), so it is impossible to bring or manifest Logrus energy there (and very bad things happen if you succeed despite Corwin's prohibition).

Corwin's acknowledged offspring include:
* His son [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin) by Dara
* His daughter [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin)
* His acknowledged son (by unknown circumstance) [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin)

Other offspring:
* [Hubert](HubertOfCorwin) has claimed to be Corwin's grandson

Through complicated means (aka [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters)) there are now two Corwins running around[1]:
* Original Corwin, now beastmastered into clown makeup and large clown feet with the Pattern stripped out of him
* a spiritual duplicate of Corwin that was incarnated into sand ("Sandy Corwin") and regenerated into fleshy form because Amberite.

We decided that we prefer the duplicate Corwin and consider him the "real" one and ignore the original, who has not been seen since the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).

[1] There are currently two versions of Corwin running around.

One is the original CorwinOfOberon, who had all his [pattern](PrimalPattern) bits ripped out of his being by Julian at one point, making him shadow-lame.  Corwin was brought back as a zombie by [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters), who kept a copy in [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters)'s [Head](NortonsHead).

The zombie tried to monitor a [Trump](TrumpDeck) call made by [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin), and blew up, trapping his soul in a TrumpDeck.  [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) locked the deck in [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) [Throne](KolvirPromontory#castleamber), where it remained until it turned up in <a href="www.omega16.org">Omega16</a>.  After being brought back in Omega, Corwin was made over into the "Clown Prince" instead of the "Crown Prince", and suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the [Warlord Marial](RealmsLords).  He is not highly regarded, and was in [Shadow](ShadowPlaces) at the time of the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).

The second Corwin is known as "Sandy Corwin" due to having been a copy in [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters)'s [head](NortonsHead) for a while, and then gotten out by being poured (carefully) into a sand-sculpture of himself. Eventually, his endurance healed him.  He is much more highly regarded; something about not being able to do anything but watch, and play cards with the other folks in [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters]'s [Head](NortonsHead) (for quite some time) seems to have built up his humanity some more.  (Another successful rehabilitation by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) and [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara)?)  He is currently the "Real Corwin" and is running [Pearl](CorwinPromontory) with [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon), until she was "promoted" to [King of Amber](KingOfAmber).
