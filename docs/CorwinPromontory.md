## Argent

The [promontory](Cosmology) that all that [Corwin's Pattern](CorwinPattern) effects.

## Pearl

Pearl is the kingdom that [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) founded on the promontory where he drew his [Pattern](CorwinPattern), drawn during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall) as a backup to the main [Pattern](PrimalPattern).

[Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) went out of his way to bar other powers from his promontory; the [Time Lord](RealmsLords) [Melkizedek](TimeLordMelkizedek) had to roll back one situation that involved a [Logrus](TheLogrus) blade, [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara), [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), and [Osric](OsricOfChanicut) that (briefly) resulted in Pearl being destroyed.

During the aftereffects of [Ingold's](IngoldOfBenedict) undrawing of his [Super Pattern](SuperPattern), The whole promontory was moved (pushed?) outward into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance).  Since [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) was careful to keep [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) out of Pearl, there has been little contact with those on this promontory since then.  This is one of the promotories in the Great Atol Project.

The current ruler of Pearl is presumed to be [(formerly) Sandy Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) until [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) comes back to rule jointly with him, after stepping down from being [King](KingOfAmber).
