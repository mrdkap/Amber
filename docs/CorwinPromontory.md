## Argent

The promontory that all that [Corwin's Pattern](CorwinPattern) effects.

## Pearl

Pearl is the kingdom that [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) founded on the promontory where he drew his [Pattern](CorwinPattern), drawn during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall) as a backup to the main [Pattern](PrimalPattern).

[Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) went out of his way to bar other powers from his promontory; the [Time Lord](RealmsLords) [Melkizedek](TimeLordMelkizedek) had to roll back one situation that involved a [Logrus](TheLogrus) blade, [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara), [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), and [Osric](OsricOfChanicut) that (briefly) resulted in Pearl being destroyed.

During the aftereffects of [Ingold's](IngoldOfBenedict) undrawing of his [Super Pattern](SuperPattern), The [Pattern](CorwinPattern) in Pearl was moved (pushed?) outward into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance).  Since [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) was careful to keep [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) out of Pearl, there has been no contact with this promontory since then.

The current ruler of Pearl is presumed to be [(formerly) Sandy Corwin](CorwinOfOberon).
