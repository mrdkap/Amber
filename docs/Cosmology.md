There are many ways to look at the universe, and all of them are right and all of them are wrong.

One way is to consider a book:  two cover and pages in between.  One cover is Amber, the other cover is
Chaos, and the pages in between are Shadow.  People who can travel Shadows can step from one page to another,
eventually ending up at one of the covers.  The covers are thicker and "realer" than the pages in between.

A second way is to consider Jell-O: imagine a bowl of jello with fruit added.  The jello is the Sea of Chance, the
primal Chaos that all the worlds are soaking in. Each piece of fruit is a stable place in the Sea of Chance,
which some player characters decided to call a "promontory".

What makes a stable space in the Sea?  One common answer is a kind of plantlike creature dubbed a 'kraken'
that grows in the Sea of Chance and feed while accumulating 'stuff' on top and becoming a stable place.  Another
answer is a Serpent that has curled up and accumulates material from the Sea of Chance.  

A third way is to consider opposing and balancing forces and their centers.  The focus of a power, like
the Pattern of Order, may have an opposing focus located 'nearby'.  The interaction between these powers
creates Shadow (saran wrap around two pieces of fruit in our bowl of jello). Other foci like the Spiral of
Magic don't have an opposite focus that generates power.

A sufficiently large area of Shadow may overlap with other promontories, allowing cross-shadow travel
to them.  There's no obvious way on "top" to figure out that this area is a promontory, except that
these areas are much Realer and that most power foci are located on promontories.

It doesn't seem required that power foci are on promontories, but foci not located on a promontory may
be in trouble if something happens to the Shadow they are in.
