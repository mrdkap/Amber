Count Alessandro di Cagliostro is the ruler of [one of the smallest countries in his world, the County of Cagliostro](https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/blob/master/info/shadows/echoes_of_avalon.md).  Cagliostro the country is a mountain valley in the Alps with a single city.  The crust of that entire world has been flensed and relocated to [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory), with all the disruption that entailed.

Publicly, Count Cagliostro is the latest in a string of rulers of Cagliostro dating back more than a century.
Privately, there are crazy rumors about the Count being some sort of immortal sorcerer who founded the Freemasons.  Perish the thought!

Cagliostro remembers being hundreds of years old, and being imprisoned in a cave by the Inquisition.  Napoleon Bonaparte freed him from the cave to help with what became a disastrous invasion to the east.  After that, Cagliostro founded his namesake country and spent lifetimes crafting the Philosopher's Stone with the help of demons bound to his service. 

It has become apparent to him that much, if not all of that memory is false but that these artificial memories are of his own devising.

What is known:
* Caglistro had a wife and a daughter, that he had forgotten about
* When his wife died or was killed, Cagliostro took actions against those he felt responsible, and his later guilt at those actions
* He appears to have had a brother or someone else who resembled him, and [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) threw that man into a sandstorm we believe was [Cemen](CemenTheUnmaker)
* His house of demon "servants" is now contracted to kill him through an unbreakable obligation, in a pact Cagliostro strongly suspects he set up himself

There is no record of Cagliostro's parentage, and his daughter believes her Amberite heritage is through her mother.

[Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) has marked Cagliostro as "useful" with Serpent Power, and strictly forbidden anyone from researching his true origins.

Cagliostro is a powerful mage and conjurer, and has learned quite a few tricks in recent travels around the universes. He had created a race of Ifrit when preparing to take over and escape from a [HellPromontory].  Said takeover was not necessary, but the Ifrit did participate in the attack on [Pride's Folly](PridesFolly) and a few dozen have since trained as mages under Cagliostro's tutelage.

Cagliostro's entourage usually includes his two Sword Sisters from Darkover, his daughter [Mistress Janice of the Archives](JaniceOfCagliostro), one or more Ifrit, and frequently Cemen.  Cagliostro is attempting to help in Cemen's rehabilitation and learning of new tricks. In his absence, Cagliostro's seneschal and butler Jodo runs the County of Cagliostro and the Freemasons.  They are no longer hiring people to pretend to be Count Cagliostro after a fiasco involving one imposter and a cat burglar.
