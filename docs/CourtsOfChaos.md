Not precisely the Courts from the second series, but inspired by them, as well as Stormy's Chaos. The Courts of Chaos and the [Black Zone](BlackZone) can be thought of as roughly the size of Australia, if the Courts were flat, which they are not.

The power groups in Chaos are:
 + The [17 Major Houses, and a number of minor houses](ChaosHouses) who focus on politics
 + The [Guilds](ChaosGuilds), who are more focused on powers and hobbies than status
 + The [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos), typically a [Guild Second](ChaosGuilds) and elected by the [Major Houses](ChaosHouses)
 + The [Realms Lords](RealmsLords), ridiculously powerful people who allow the process to continue so they don't get bothered a lot.

## Chaos Details

Chaos is defined in more detail here: [http://www.train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/chaos_info.html](http://www.train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/chaos_info.html)

This page is out of date in several important respects:
 1. [Jance](JanceOfPhilosophers) from the [Philosophers](PhilosophersGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds) is no longer [King](KingOfChaos).
 1. Some of the [major houses](ChaosHouses) on the list have been destroyed, disbanded (e.g. [House Barimen](ChaosHouses)), or demoted (e.g. [House Hendrake](ChaosHouses)).
 1. Guild leadership is in flux; [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) of the [Dancers Guild](ChaosGuilds) is also (secretly) running the [Shifter Guild](ChaosGuilds) after their decimation by [Cyndia](CobalteanRoyalFamily#cyndia). [Andron](AndronOfPsionicists) and [Jenoir](JenoirOfMages) are officially dead, having combined to become the new [Realms Mage Ferethyn](RealmsLords) (after the players and NPCs conspired to drive the last one insane).
