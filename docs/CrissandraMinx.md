## Crissandra "Copperfield" Minx

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Current leader of the [Charlie Team](DrashirStrikeTeams).

A woman who loves confusing people. From going by "Cris", to having a
call sign that invokes a man, to occasionally shifting her habits on
purpose, Cris got [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s attention with the way she
would lure the enemy into habits to then be exploited. After a few
victory drinks, he asked her, for fun, to plan a heist with four other
people. [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) was impressed by the plan and used the
maneuvers on his next mission. Afterward, he sent a portion of his
take to Cris as a thank you. A year later, she started working for
him, and two years after that, she took control of Charlie.
