Cymnea, being of the most powerful family in the [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [House](ChaosHouses) [Barimen](HouseBarimen), is one of the four children of Cornelius the Great. This made her Oberonâ€™s aunt, just ... not necessarily by blood or genetics, depending on what limited understanding we have of relations in a [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [House](ChaosHouses). Nevertheless, the marriage was arranged and Cymnea became the first Queen of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir), and gave [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) three children, before his eye (and loins) wandered:

 + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon): first child, with all that brings with it.
 + [Osric](OsricOfOberon): Named for Oberon's good friend [Osric, Hero of Chanicut](OsricOfChanicut)
 + [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon): Always trying to keep up with his older brothers.

The marriage was declared to have never happened dissolved "Ab Initio", removing the boys from being in the line of succession.  This was done as a consession to [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) next wife.

Cymnea was assassinated during [Faiella's](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma) lifetime, and there was no evidence of an investigation, which people took to mean that either [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), or her family commissioned it.
