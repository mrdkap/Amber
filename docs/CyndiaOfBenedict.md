Daughter of [Benedict](BenedictOfAmber) and part of the [Cobalt Bush](%base_url%/assets/CobaltXtreeXcolor.GIF) as she is also the daughter of [Cynthia](CobalteanRoyalFamily), who is the daughter of [Aurelia](CobalteanRoyalFamily) and her brother [Duke](CobalteanRoyalFamily) (missing), [Dana's](CobalteanRoyalFamily) children.  She is the mother of [Sirona](CobalteanRoyalFamily) (missing) by her mother's half-brother [Finndo](CobalteanRoyalFamily), and [Charlemange](CobalteanRoyalFamily) by her mother's sister's ([Erica](CobalteanRoyalFamily)) child [Beauregard](BeauregardOfBenedict).  She is not a grandmother, that she knows of.  She is slightly worried that [Charlemange](CobalteanRoyalFamily) might be a bit strange, having the morally stiff-necked [Benedict](BenedictOfAmber) on both his mother's and his father's side.  But he seems to have turned out acceptibly [Cobaltian](CobalteanRoyalFamily), being the head of Cobalt's legal apparatus, even though he has not yet seen fit to have children. 

She has taken over the [Chaosian](CourtsOfChaos) [Warrior's](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds).
