The Dancers [Guild](ChaosGuilds#dancers) is where all high-class entertainment comes from.  From consultants, to people at your event, the Dancers [Guild](ChaosGuilds#dancers) is a full-service bureau.

They pride themselves on change, and style, knowing just the right touches, who can be seated near whom, the right music, the right costumes, the right shapes, to make (or break) your event.  They have tiers of services, for various prices and costs.

They have even been known to, on occasion, get the [Assassins Guild](AssassinsGuild) to put temporary stays on contracts to ease and allow for contracted activities to happen.

[Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) has been Guildmaster since it's founding, and has been known to take personal interest if the occasion is grand enough.

It is rumored that [Flora](FlorimelOfAmber) got some of her training at this Guild.
