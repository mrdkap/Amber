[Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Faiella's](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma) youngest daughter, younger sister to [Eric](EricOfOberon) and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon).  Mother of [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin). King in [Amber](KolvirPromontory).

>and then there was a black-haired girl with the same blue eyes, and her hair hung long and she was dressed all in black, with a girdle of silver about her waist. My eyes filled with tears, why I don't know. Her name was Deirdre. [Nine Princes in Amber]

Deirdre kept the Jewel from falling over the side with Brand, and was thought to be mortally wounded in the process.  In reality, Corwin smuggled her into [Pearl](CorwinPromontory) where she remained for some time. There, she helped to raise her daughter [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) and build a relationship with [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin), when he came there to retire from Amber politics and activities. After Oberon's death, and the end of Oberon's edict about incest, and some convincing from both [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), she has taken her rightful place as [King](KingOfAmber) of [Amber](KolvirPromontory), after verifying that, indeed, she could walk the [new Pattern](NevilleAuriclePattern). She appointed [Auricle](AuricleOfTir) as Regent, and went off to clean up some of the mess her Aunt has left behind.

Deidre's acknowledged offspring include:
 + Her daughter [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) by Corwin.
 + Her adopted son [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) (adopted due to [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin)'s insistance)
 + She has also "adopted" a number of cats (Sha'um) and some of Benedict's abandonded line, as well, but not officially. [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict) and his line have referred to her as "mom" instad of "aunt" on more than one occasion.
