The Demon Goddess Verra from [Stephen Brust's Vlad Taltos series](http://www.greenmanreview.com/taltos.htm). Her name stems from the fact that demons worship her; a common form of sacrifice is a city. Verra's center of power is the [Paths of the Dead](DragaeraPromontory), but her worship was common in [Dragaera](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~kesinger/brust/).  It's not clear whether [Dragaera](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~kesinger/brust/) survived the undrawing of the [Super Pattern](SuperPattern) and/or the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).

Also, the little sister of [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers).

Verra-worship was promoted by the PCs (particularly [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel)), the Prophet of Verra as a replacement for [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin)-worship after the latter's defeat.

Verra has been seen to use the [Void](TheVoid) at least once.
