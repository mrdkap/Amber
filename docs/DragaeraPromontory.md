The Dragaera Promontory is a promotory much like [Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos/Khaavren Romances series](http://www.greenmanreview.com/taltos.htm).  It has two elements to it.

## [Dragera](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~kesinger/brust/)

A gift, at one point, as far as we can tell, to Sethra, from [Verra](DemonGoddessVerra).

## The Paths of the Dead

The Paths of the Dead are the home-place and hangout of [Rainbow's](RainbowOfDancers) sister [Verra](DemonGoddessVerra), Sethra Lavode, and a [Mecha-Jean](JeanOfFlorimel).
