A cross-promontory collection of dragons, that are about as much of a ruling body as dragons are willing to inflict on themselves.  They meet irregularly in the Dragon Council room which is a promontory standing alone in the [Sea](SeaOfChance).  It is a sandy declivity inside a cave or greater declivity.  The sand is warm and glows somewhat, and there is no outside light. If a visitor is succeptable to radiation poisoning, they should take precautions.  If a visitor is uninvited, they should also take precautions against dragon damage, and tooth and claw damage as well.
