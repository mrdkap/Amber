## Drashir "Drae" Blitzen

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

A gentleman of a medium build walking slowly into his middle years,
Drae has a calming demeanor as if a bamboo reed studied to be a
bartender. His kind brown eyes always stay as such, even when an
exasperated sigh graces his features. Always in a black-on-black
ensemble of dress pants, a button-down shirt with sleeves rolled up,
and suede sneakers, Drae can either command the attention of the room
or fade into the background. His rimless black glasses complete the
effect of a knowledgeable person by the standards of society. His
positive demeanor drops an octave when the conversation turns to the
business of a more visceral nature. It is then that his
shoulder-length dreadlocks are pulled into a ponytail and he is here
to talk, about tactics, resources, options, and victory.

He is the owner and operator of a high-end "gym" in downtown Manhattan. 
Climbing walls, dojo, and Circus Arts.  Strong personality.  Skillful
teacher.  Good judge of character. [Helen](HelenWait) is the main
receptionist there.

He is the secret owner and operator, through several LLCs of a
high-end "escape room" facility, in one of the warehouse buildings in
Manhattan. There are a number of actual secure rooms and interview
rooms and the like hidden amongst the puzzle rooms.

He has several [Teams](DrashirStrikeTeams) working for him.  As well
as some free-lance consultants.
