## Drashir's Teams

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

While [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) plans all teams to be able to handle most
military functions, some teams have either a specialty or a
"vibe". Teams are mostly 5-person groupings with a leader. The known
exceptions are Alpha, Maven, and Kringle. Some people rotate teams for
vibe checks or to fill in necessary skills.

Alpha through Gamma are primary teams, known to [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)
and considered his personal brigade. There are a few specialty teams
outside of that grouping that are also family (including Maven and
Kringle).  From Hotel team on, those designations are for
mission-specific freelancers who are not always part of the personal
brigade.

Team makeup:
 * Alpha
   The most cohesive unit. Its goal is to be ready for everything. As
   [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) sometimes has to plan on the fly, they are
   trained to trust those on the fly decisions even when fear would
   have them act otherwise. Alpha is usually 6 because
   [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) is with them. Also, they can expand to 7 if
   they are training a replacement. (As they did with the current
   lead.) He needed to gel with who and what Alpha already was before
   [Millie](MaximillianMastersonIII) could go to Beta.
   + [Horrorshow](HoratioDorinto)
   - 
   - Third: Breach expert/door kicker (and really loves her job.)
   - 
   - 
 * Bravo
   Their specialization is slightly strange, but it is based on
   [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s trust in their leader. They are designed
   to function completely autonomously without any support from the
   rest of the teams, if necessary. When [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) needs
   an ace in the hole to be in play and not be seen on the board
   until the endgame, he'll give Bravo the mission and know they will
   be there and ready when the time comes. The team has experts in
   survival and resource acquisition.
   + [Millie](MaximillianMastersonIII)
   - 
   - 
   - 
   - 
 * Charlie
   They are all about distractions. The specialists there handle
   practical gear as well as hacking into enemy communications when
   capable of causing as much misdirection in the enemy as
   possible. Be it a multi-satellite hack, a "poorly timed" accident
   in an unsuspecting convoy, or just a well-placed smoke
   bomb. Charlie keeps the deck shuffled so no one but
   [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) knows where the aces are.
   + [Copperfield](CrissandraMinx)
   - 
   - 
   - 
   - 
 * Delta
   Delta. Is. Loud. One of the most aggressive teams under
   [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s command. Delta team is heavy weapons,
   fortified breaches, overpowering shows of force, and a damn good
   time. It's occasionally hysterical how freakishly quiet Delta can
   be before the storm. It is an obvious sign that
   [Horrorshow](HoratioDorinto) was second in command there before he
   was transferred to Alpha.
   + [Fuse](GilbertLincoln)
   - 
   - Third: Gifter of the blow gun
   - 
   - 
 * Epsilon
   Officially, Epsilon's specialty is "counterattack"; a unit
   designed to pay attention in longer excursions and pivot to strike
   back at the current pain points. In actuality, Epsilon's focus is
   "vengeance". The team is most upset when someone is being taken
   advantage of, or hurt. Epsilon excels at tracking, incapacitating,
   and extracting retribution from targets that deserve their
   attention. Leaving them in a town where the innocent are being
   held hostage is the equivalent of setting off a biblical culling
   of the firstborn. And they leave mercy to [Drae](DrashirBlitzen),
   for that is not their calling.
   - [Karma](ArialLi)
   - 
   - 
   - Wolfe (female): Quiet all the time. Quick when necessary. Very
     much gives back threefold.
   - 
 * Foxtrot
   - Lead missing (James Earlson proposed.)
   - 
   - 
   - 
   - 
 * Kringle
 * Mavin
 * Specter
