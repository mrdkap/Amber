From *Nine Princes in Amber*:
	> "He was a small man. Tiny, might be an even better word. He was around five feet tall and a hunchback. His hair and beard were as heavy as [Corwin's] own. The only distinguishing features in that great mass of fur were his long, hook nose and his almost black eyes, now squinted against the light."

An [Old Lord](OldLord) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), former [Mathematician](ChaosGuilds#mathematicians) and guildmaster of the [Crafters](ChaosGuild#crafters). Hunchbacked shapeshifter, ultimate ancestor of the [Amberite](WhoIsWhereAmberites) line, author of the [Primal Patern](PrimalPattern). Dworkin learned [Trump](TrumpDeck) from [Darkstar](DarkStar).

Dworkin was insane for millenia, because [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) tricked him into drawing a [Pattern](PrimalPattern) that turned him crazy. He was recently (and accidentally) re-saned by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), his apprentice in the Jester's Guild of Amber.  [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) has expended considerable effort in maintaining Dworkin at a reasonable sanity level since then.

Various alternate-reality Dworkins have been seen running around, including [Hillbilly Dworkin](HillbillyDworkin) and the very insane [Wonder Dworkin](WonderDworkin), [Alice](AliceOfDworkin)'s father. A then-crazy Dworkin [Trumped](TrumpDeck) his descendants and impressed upon them the ability to recognize the local Dworkin - "I am your Dworkin, and you shall have no Dworkins before me, for I am a jealous Dworkin!"

The local Dworkin has had three children, two of which did not turn out well:
 1. [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), born of Dworkin and [the (male) Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber): one-time King of [Amber](KolvirPromontory) and right bastard.
 1. [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), [Clarissa's](ClarissaOfDarkover) daughter: multiple menace to Reality.
 1. [Ferro Marz](FerroOfDworkin), a marzipan golem created by Dworkin, [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy), and [Darkstar](DarkStar).  For an insane, shapeshifting compulsive [Pattern](PrimalPattern)-author, Ferro's turned out well.

Dworkin has recently participated in an orgy in [Cobalt](CobaltPromontory), so some new descendants are likely in that [bloodline](CobalteanRoyalFamily)
