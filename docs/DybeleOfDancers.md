Dybele, while married to [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) gave birth to their shared daughter [Florimel](FlorimelOfAmber).

She is (or was, for she is now missing) a long-time member of the [Dancers Guild](ChaosGuilds), and one who was raised, carefully, to not have [Logrus](TheLogrus) trace, and be acceptible to the [Pattern](PrimalPattern) specifically for jobs on the [Amber](KolvirPromontory) side of things.

She trained with [Rose](ChaosGuilds#ambassadors) for some time, and had a hand in training [Neville](NevilleOfEric).
