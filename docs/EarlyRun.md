## Run Starts
 + [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) helps defend the forces of [Amber](WhoIsWhereAmberites) at the [Bare Spot](BareSpot) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), and is cheered on by [House Cara](HouseCara), who is sitting out [Pattern Fall](PatternFall).
## Divergence
Summary of the [divergence](http://plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/divergent_point.html) events:
 + [Caine](CaineOfOberon) kills [Brand](BrandOfOberon) , but a mortally wounded [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) saves the [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement) from the [Abyss](TheAbyss) heroically.
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) survives repairing the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern), and arrives at the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos) with fresh troops.  He makes/renews an arrangement with the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) leaves to [his own reality](CorwinPromontory) to mourn [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon).
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) is rescued from a century of torture in [House Hendrake](HouseHendrake), and is returned to something approximating Amberoid form by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin). [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) is unofficially recognized as a bastard by one of the Amber Royal family and a descendant of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
 + Most of [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) children return to [Amber](ShadowKolvir), but [Random](RandomOfOberon) becomes [Amber's](ShadowKolvir) ambassador to the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Jance](JanceOfPhilosophers), guild second of the [Philosophers](PhilosophersGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds), is elected [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos), replacing [Borel](BorelOfHendrake).
## The Early Years Of Run
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) walks the [Pattern](KolvirPattern) and is fully restored.
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) obtains the sword Galantine from [Tazik](TazikTheSwordmaker), the weapons crafter, who crafts it uniquely for him. (More information in his logs: [1](https://train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_1.txt) [2](https://train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_2.txt) [2a](https://train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_2a.txt) [3](https://train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_3.txt)) 
 + [Connor](ConnorOfFiona) plays with time and is trapped in a massively slowed personal timeflow in [Amber's](ShadowKolvir) gardens.  It saves his life later.
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) takes the "Wand of Not Yet" from [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict)'s office.
 + [Toram](ToramOfMages) (or his allies) place massive blocks in [Shadow](ShadowPlaces) against [Pattern](PrimalPattern), [Logrus](TheLogrus), and [Trump](TrumpDeck).  Since those blocks tend to be ignored by anyone powerful enough to deal with them, they remain more or less intact until (presumably) the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).
 + [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) walks the [Pattern](PrimalPattern), while white statues of a winged woman wearing sunglasses appear throughout many [shadows](ShadowPlaces), mostly not near [Amber](ShadowKolvir).
 + [House Hendrake](HouseHendrake) is disbanded as a house (or demoted to a minor house?), and its members participate in one last suicidal attack on [Amber](ShadowKolvir).
 + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) is stripped of his title of Marshal of Amber (or resigns his place before [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) gets himself killed ignoring [Benedict's](BenedictOfOberon) advice).
## The [Locked Room Party](LockedRoomParty) Theme Begins

 + [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) and [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy) create [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) out of marzipan (with a bit of help from [DarkStar](DarkStar)), and send him over to scold [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
 + For a time, the Manato blockade [Amber's](ShadowKolvir) harbor. [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) leads a caravan to bring supplies into [Amber](ShadowKolvir), and makes a fair amount of money doing so.
## Julian Invades Arden
 + [Julian](JulianOfOberon), upset at losing responsibility and just generally obnoxious, invades [Arden](ForestOfArden), but is persuaded to leave by [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) ([log](http://www2.primushost.com/~dskern/www/amber/log960611.html#julian)).
 + [Cathryn](CathrynOfRandom) and others assist [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) in collecting [Draegearan](DragaeraPromontory) personages of power, who are apparently turned into [Grey Spheres](GreySphere).
 + [Julian](JulianOfOberon) fights a duel with [Cathryn](CathrynOfRandom) at the Mazelands, in which [Cathryn](CathrynOfRandom) is victorious ([log](http://www2.primushost.com/~dskern/www/amber/log960625.html#duel)).

 + [Rivka](RivkaOfBenedict) teleports into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) to avoid [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s wrath for violating his edict (having slept with a few of her relatives, including [her father, Benedict](BenedictOfOberon)).
    + During [Rivka](RivkaOfBenedict)'s conversation with [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), he mentions a child from an illicit relationship between [Eric](EricOfOberon) and [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon).

    + [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy), [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu), and others argue with [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) about the nature of and cause of recent incursions of foreign realities.
## [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) holds [Amber](ShadowKolvir) Formal Court
 + [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon), via [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), announces that she has left [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s service and [Amber](ShadowKolvir) is without a steward.

## Cross-reality hopping
 + [Julian](JulianOfOberon) invades [Arden](ForestOfArden), again.  This time, he apparently uses [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon)'s shock troops from the [shadow](ShadowPlaces) Tarinal,
    + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) and his rangers use land mines and artillery powered by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon)'s pink powder
    + [House Cara](HouseCara) sends an army to assist in the defense, which includes troops from [Ilk's](IlkandacianOfCara) Home and [Zach's](ZachariasOfJulian) undead [Sidhe](TitaniaOfFaerie) Warriors.
    + For the first (but not for the last) time, [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) explodes.  This time, it is because his spells are unracked by [Julian](JulianOfOberon).

    + In this reality, [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin) is [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos), [Random](RandomOfOberon) is [King of Amber](KingOfAmber) (with one son, [Martin](MartinOfRandom)) and [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom)'s grandmother is the childless (and ruthless) head of [House Jesby](ChaosHouses).  It is later mentioned that in this reality (I believe) that [Llewella](LlewellaOfOberon) is the new [Faerie Queen](TitaniaOfFaerie), as of six hundred years ago.
    + After re-coalessing, [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) also falls through the crack into this same alternate reality.
       + [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) befriends [Ilaryn the "Badger Babe"](Ilaryn), and this reality will be christened the [Badger Verse](BadgerVerse)
 + Two alternate (non-local) [Oberons](OberonOfDworkin) argue (violently) in [Amber](ShadowKolvir), but trump home with help from the local [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber)
 + A delegation from [Cobalt](CobaltPromontory), searching for missing relatives is recieved.
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom), [Theraat](TheraatOfVale), a [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), and a [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) arrive in [Omega](http://www.omega16.org)
 + [Cathryne's](CatheryneOfRandom) party (including [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian)) arrives in another alternate universe, where that [Cara](HouseCara) vivisects the [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) traveling with [Cathryne](CatheryneOfRandom), keeping her alive magically. This is the reality of "Bob - The Logrus" and "Joe - The Abyss", and there was also a chained [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) in a room one over from [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon).
 + Quote of the evening: "People who think they know everything greatly annoy those of us who do."
