This is a lovely little world, filled with grazing lands, sheep that breed by fission, really warm ground, lots of grass for the sheep to eat folded landscape that is overall curved like the inside of an egg would be.  THe sky peaks overhead like... well the pointed end of an egg.

It has been used as a hatching ground for dragons for time out of mind.  It is mostly fireproof, self-sustaining and really boring.  Except when there is a new flight of young dragons.  Then ... it tends to be fairly interesting.  In that "May you live in interesting times." way.
