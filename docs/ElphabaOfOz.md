There once was a wicked witch in Oz.  Who played politics, got power, and yet, still, in the end, stood enough by her green friend Elphaba, such that, when she had to go to run and hide in the outer worlds beyond Oz, she did her best to convince everyone Elphaba was dead and gone.

This is her story since.

Accompanied by her once-alive (and now straw) lover and co-conspirator [Fiyero](FiyeroOfOz) and her book Grimm she set forth for new places to be, and worlds to find.

Under the tutelage of Grimm, she reached a place where she could carve her own spot, not hampered (as much) by the prejudices of those around her.  In this place she was honored, and respected, since she could reach into "The Well" where the others could not dip so deep.

Then, [adventure](20190914-GatheringOfMages) called upon her, and she set forth, into an [Amberverse](https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/wiki).

She is now also accompanied by Vivian an (undead) lioness.

Comments that all she needs is a dog, and a tin man are not looked on with charity.
