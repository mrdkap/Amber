[Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) describing Eric:

> Then there was Eric. Handsome by anyone's standards, his hair was so dark as to be almost blue. His beard curled around the mouth that always smiled, and he was dressed simply in a leather jacket and leggings, a plain cloak, high black boots, and he wore a red sword belt bearing a long silvery saber and clasped with a ruby, and his high cloak collar round his head was lined with red and the trimmings of his sleeves matched it. His hands, thumbs hooked behind his belt, were terribly strong and prominent. A pair of black gloves jutted from the belt near his right hip.

Eric, oldest son of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), although illegitimate. Eric died nobly "For the Good of Amber" during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall), was briefly restored by [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) but proceeded to be such a jerk that he is only used as a source of [pattern-power](PrimalPattern), an "Eric Grenade" to use in a battle in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), and an object of momentary torment.

Eric's only known issue is [Eric Junior, also known as Neville](NevilleOfEric) of [House Helgram](HouseHelgram), later [King Eric II of Amber](KingOfAmber).

It is rumored that once [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) was grown up (or possibly before), he fell in love with her, and didn't want to be entangled with anyone else, on the off-chance she might decide to go with him.  This made him somewhat open to manipulation by [Julian](JulianOfOberon).
