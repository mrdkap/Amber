Known by their badge, and their impartiality, the Etiquette [Guild](ChaosGuilds#etiquette) is often the means of settling disputes, communicating between, and striking deals with other [guilds](ChaosGuilds), [houses](ChaosHouses), and individuals in the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).

They are the arbiters of duels, the proof of agreements, and their records are available for the appropriate perusal by effected and interested parties.

They hold all the proper forms, for those who need or want to know them, how someone of the rank and position of the person asking is to properly approach pretty much anyone of consequence across the known spectrum of beings inhabiting [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  Including several "you don't" (most individuals and the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) for example) or "Scream and Run" when "approaching" [Pharaban](PharabanOfPharaban) as another example.

Recently they were infiltrated and became impersonated by a malicious force, and the real guild was being sheltered by the then [King](KingOfChaos) [Osric](OsricOfChannicut).

This means that much of the business of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) is currently on hold, and there can't be a council meeting at [Thelbane](CastleThelbane) until they are restored, or visited.
