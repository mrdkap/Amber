The [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) from the [Evil-Verse](EvilAmber). This Oberon was not clean. He had half a face - you could see the skull peeled back. One arm was covered with scales, and the other was made out of bone.

Evil Oberon got into a long and bloody fight with [Hillbilly Dworkin](HillbillyDworkin), and lost.
