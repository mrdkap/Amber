Faiella, princess of the royal family in [Begma](GoldenCircleKingdoms) was [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) first recorded experiment to see if his blood-line was tied to his [House](ChaosHouses) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), or if he could produce heirs elsewhere.  A dalliance with one family that seemed to have enough longevity as well as royalty to begin to build alliances, as well as power for his rapidly growing Kingdom. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, his dalliance (which produced [Eric](EricOfOberon)) happened while he was still married to [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen).

Because of the insistance of her family, [Cymnea's](CymneaOfBarimen) marriage was dissolved "Ab Initio" so none of the previous children ([Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), [Osric](OsricOfOberon), or [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon)) nor their heirs were in line for the throne.

Perhaps, as a slight consideration, though, [Eric](EricOfOberon) was never acknowledged, not that that changed either [Eric'](EricOfOberon) or [Neville's](NevilleOfEric) claim on the throne.

Mother of:
 + [Eric](EricOfOberon): (Theoretically Illegitimate)
 + [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon): Gave up his claim to the throne in favor of [Pearl](CorwinPromontory), and is now doubled in both "Sandy" and "Clown Prince" versions of self.
 + [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon): With whom she died in childbirth, who is now [King of Amber](KingOfAmber)

[Begma](GoldenCircleKingdoms) is no more, obliterated by [Realms Master Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) when he was investigating the rise of [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) and wiped it to its foundation. [log](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log990706.html)

There is speculation that [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) targeted [Begma](GoldenCircleKingdoms) specifically because of what Faiella meant to [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
