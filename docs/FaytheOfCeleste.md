[Celeste's](CelesteOfBleys) daughter. Engaged to [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters). Head of [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory), and part of a four-way balance with:
 + [Titania](TitaniaOfFarie)([Faerie](FaeriePromotory))
 + [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters)([Undeath](UnDeath))
 + [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel)([Unlife](UnLife))

Faythe is an empathic healer with the brain the size of a planet;
there's very little she can't fix but at considerable cost to herself.

For a brief period, Chaos considered Faythe the King of Amber for political reasons.  Faythe was picked as the heir to her mother Celeste, who had been the regent for [Malachi](MalachiOfCorwin), who was picked as the regent after [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) disappearance.
At the time Amber was depopulated save for [Evil Benedict](EvilBenedict).

Since Faythe had never been to Amber, Norton and Jean had to explain the
kingdom and the family history to her. The [Hamsterites](WhoIsWhereHamsterites) were created as
a side effect of this explanation.
