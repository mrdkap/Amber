[Dworkin's](DworkinOfAmber) third child and the only good one so far. Also considered [Suhuy's](RealmsLords#suhuy) child.

The Marzipan Man: Ferro was a golem created by Dworkin, Suhuy, Darkstar, and Stormy out of marzipan during the Locked Room Party.  Specifically built to scold Oberon as his first action in life and survive the experience.

Banished from the Courts of Chaos by the Realms Master for trying to draw a Pattern in the basement of House Jesby. Stuck in a bottle for quite some time before being rescued by Ilkandacian after Oberon's return.

During the battle against Oberon, the characters discovered that Oberon had shapeshifted the Kolvir pattern into shis body.  A newly rescued Ferro then ripped the Kolvir Pattern out of Oberon's body and unwalked it.  Ferro helped defeat Oberon.

Later, Ferro unwalked the Primal Pattern.  This restored Dworkin's sanity in our local universe but apparently destroyed Ferro.
