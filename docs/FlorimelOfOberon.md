''The woman behind the desk wore a wide-collared, V-necked dress of blue-green, had long hair and low bangs, all of a cross between sunset clouds and the outer edge of a candle flame in an otherwise dark room, and natural, I somehow knew, and her eyes behind glasses I didn't think she needed were as blue as Lake Erie at three o'clock on a cloudless summer afternoon; and the color of her compressed smile matched her hair.''

Daughter of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), current paramour of [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers), with a fair number of former lovers to her credit.  Flora is the mother of [Jackie](JackieOfFlorimel), [Amaranth Sinclair](AmaranthOfFlorimel) (with [Mandor](MandorOfSawall)) and [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) (with [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers)).

There have been signs of a cross-reality Flora cabal.
