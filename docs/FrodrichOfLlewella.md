Younger child of [Llewella](LlewellaOfOberon) and (it is rumered) a dolphin.

Unlike his older brother [Caeralethien](CaeralethienOfLlewella) he had little to no interest in politics in Rebma.  After the passing of his [grandmother](MoinsOfRebma) and the whole "no one is stating outloud that it had anything to do with [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover)" he left Rebma to some place far enough away that trumps of him didn't reach him.

He and his brother were born a mere 10 years apart.  One of the closest siblings in age, and the furthest in temperment.

He was rumored to be a subtle or partial shape-shifter.  He is known to have walked the pattern, and is an acknowledged child of Llewella, so therefore technically a heir to the Rebman throne, should [Queen Moire](MoireOfRebma) be no more.

Probably in some beautiful, peaceful, idyllic underwater paradise, enjoying his life far away from any hint of politics, especially when his wife Maribel comes and visits him and his [daughter](LavanyaOfFrodrich).
