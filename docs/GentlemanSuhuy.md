Gentleman Suhuy, also known as ecto-Suhuy or Hillbilly Suhuy was the creator of the [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) as the fulfillment of an experiment.

Killed by his [brother](HillbillyDworkin) for ownership of the [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) before finding out if he could attune to it.  Apparently being brothers is not a close enough relationship for such to work.

Gentleman Suhuy spent much time as a ghost, befriended by [Deirdre](HillbillyDeirdre), who was (voluntarily) giving him life-force to help them both escape [Hillbilly Amber](HillbillyAmber).

Rescued by [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin), who ended up inscribing a pattern on a bottle, over Suhuy's gravesite, he has been around and helpful on many an altercation and adventure.
