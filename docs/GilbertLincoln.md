## Gilbert "Fuse" Lincoln

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Current leader of the [Delta Team](DrashirStrikeTeams).

Gilbert is a planner. You don't survive being a high explosives expert
for over a decade with all your limbs and digits without planning. To
him, planning a big boom is like planning a party: you do all your
prep work, and then you can cut loose and enjoy the carnage. Gilly and
[Horo](HoratioDorinto) are like brothers, and they ran Delta together
like a finely tuned machine. Gilly would make the plan that
[Horo](HoratioDorinto) could calmly and effortlessly execute until it
was time to explode... which he did with deadly efficiency. It was
Gilbert who recommended [Horatio](HoratioDorinto) for Alpha, much to
[Horo](HoratioDorinto)'s surprise. But [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) saw it
in Fuse's eyes: the kind-hearted soldier wanted to see his "little
bro" make it. Fuse is probably the most outwardly kind and happy
soldier under [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s command.
