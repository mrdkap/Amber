Those [Shadows](ShadowPlaces) with whom [Amber](ShadowKolvir) has commerce, and usually treaties.

Repopulated by [King Eric II](NevilleOfEric) incognito as the "Great Protector" after [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin)'s defeat.

Some of the Kingdoms were wiped out entirely by [Realms Master Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) during an investigation into [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin)-taint.

The Golden Circle kingdoms have taken some damage and much rearrangement after falling onto the shores of [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory) after the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).

(This list seems to have gone missing, trying to recreate on the fly)
Gone - Fell into the sea

Caught on the shore - empty
 + Begma - wiped by [Realms Master Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu).  Was where [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma) was from.  Possibly targeted by [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) Because of family history.
 + The Western Marches - Where a lot of the "Shock troops" were recruited from.  Very warlike folks that, up until the [Gwenification](GwenOfDworkin) was very noble and honorable.  Unfortunately the cults to that statue encouraged less honorable warfare, and everyone who was not wiped out, now lives in exile, broken, due to their betrayals and shattering of the code they lived by.  Every year, on an anniversary, the broken ones gather for a ceremony that is ... not pretty, and allows no outsiders to watch.

Caught on the shore - (re)populated
 + Tremere - Known for it's fish and fishing exports. [Rilga](RilgaQueenOfTremere) was Queen there for a while, when [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) seduced, and eventually married her. It is a large promentory made out of almost entirely water, basically everything they do is from the sea, with the kelp farms, the fisharies, the shrimping and oyster-seed-beds and the like. Lots of coral, a few coral-islands, and a volcanic island,  which has the seat of the royalty on it, as well as the only town. Also heavily targeted by [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) but survived better due to [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin)'s, [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin)'s, and [Rivka](RivkaOfBenedict)'s efforts.
 + Jasmin - Known for it's meat exports.  Serena, [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin)'s betrohed was (is?) ambassador from there. (Malachai's journal)
  + Triticum - Exports bread, baked goods, and unprocessed grains of a variety of sorts.
  + Tristrisia - Pirate Haven and recruiting ground for Caine's and Gerard's fleets
  + Kashfa - The mines and quarries are slowly being re-opened.  Primary exports stone, metals, and gemstones.  The smithing and mason culture has a long way to go towards recovery.
  + Baylesport - Used to be a part of a larger shadow, was moved closer to Amber as a favor to Osric and Finndo, when they discoverd they really liked the alcohol exported from there.  Was just vinyards, orchards, and alcohol-making industry.  After the [Gwenification](GwenOfDworkin) was burnt down to it's roots.  The existing stocks of Bayles best (and Bayles piss) might be all that is left of them.
  + Ghenesh (Genesh?) - A Golden Circle kingdom, notable in history only in that it was there that the Moonriders were thwarted so many centuries ago. Located south of the Valley of Garnath and east of Begma.  Where the Great Spam Mountains are, defending Amber from rock-traveling invaders.
  + Megapatagonia - Ruled over by Mnemosyne, and having the main export as arts and culture, a source of muses in both senses of the word.  Her daughter Melpomene was the Ambassador to Amber for quite some time.  These long-lived (functionally immortal?) folks refined the arts to such a high degree to deal with the boredom of such a long life.  Flora has been known to heavily recruit from this kingdom for her events.

(Need to be placed, above:)
  + Juri - Delegation sent, including Sasami
  + Vain - Kal Roderick is king, smoky water chunks similar to blucite?
