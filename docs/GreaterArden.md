Greater Arden is the shadow-stuff that used to be in [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory).  It has been liberated, and is now being run by [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) and his Rangers.

Here lies:
 + Castle Amber - former seat of the [King of Amber](KingOfAmber), a sprawling manse once reinforced with pattern by [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) to deal with icky [Logrus](TheLogrus) users.  The caves beneath Castle Amber were the home of the [Kolvir Pattern](KolvirPattern) until that pattern was taken by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), who shapeshifted it into himself as a power source.  Later, the [Kolvir Pattern](KolvirPattern) was yanked out and unwalked by [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) shortly before Oberon's death.
   + The place Trump for Castle Amber goes to the courtyard, which is extensively trapped.
 + Amber City - (not yet renamed) a smallish seaport city near the castle, devastated by a number of disasters and rebuilt over the years.
   + There is a bar in Amber City that is still open; people who go in don't leave, so they apparently haven't noticed any of the problems.
   + [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) moved [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) to Amber City; the order-tolerant members of [Neville](NevilleOfEric)'s house live there.  (Most of the rest did not survive the transition.)
 + Rebma - the shadow of Amber beneath the waves.  The [Rebma Pattern](RebmaPattern) was (accidentally?) removed by [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) and used to smite [Anti-Dragons](AntiDragons), and destroyed.  Unfortunately, the special properties of Rebma were tied into that pattern.  Between the water pressure, the watchdog put there by [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) and released when the pattern was removed, and the shark children of [Llewella](LlewellaOfOberon) there were very few survivors.  The city itself did not survive.
 + Tir na Nog'th - the ghost city in the sky.  The stairway to Tir was blown out by a [Bibliomancy/Magic explosion](PowersBalancesAndOpposites), and replaced at the wrong angle.  When Tir appeared at an angle, the moon bled, and it was bad.  Eventually this was fixed, but Tir was still blocked for a while. The [Tir Pattern](TirPattern) was also removed to fight [Anti-Dragons](AntiDragons), and destroyed.  Tir has not been seen since, although there is a [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) still is in it, somewhere.
 + The Forest of Arden - Home to, and run by [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) and his Rangers originally, and has expanded to "Greater Arden", to encompase the whole shadow.
> Then there was a forest.
    And what a forest!
    I had never seen trees such as this, mighty and majestic, of a deep, rich green, slightly tinged with gold. They towered, they soared. They were enormous pines, oaks, maples, and many others which I could not distinguish. Through them crept a breeze of fantastic and lovely fragrance, when I cracked the window a bit.
