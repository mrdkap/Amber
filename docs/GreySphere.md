In appearance a Grey Sphere is a small, grey sphere. It is a prison for the inhabitant, described as three "pages" of reality each folded around the inhabitant.  It can be used as a power source by those who know.

[Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) used (and used up) Grey Spheres as power sources, and the redheads are the only ones who have appeared to understood them.  Stormy, while trying to free a redhead from a marble in an alternate universe, destroyed the Pattern a few times.

A single folded page is a ((Marble)), and is contagious.  Marbles draw their power from a bad place, and are a bad thing in general.  [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) has created many many of them.
