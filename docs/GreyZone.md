This is/was the collection of shadows that were connected to the Black Zone via ways, magic portal, or the like, all of which was basically like a suburb to the [Black Zone](BlackZone) places, for those not well-off enough or old enough to have gotten in on that surrealestate.

Lots of country mansions, bustling enterprizing businesses - catering to all sorts of needs/wants/desires, offices for many of the lesser bureaucratic workers, housing for those out of favor, but still connected, a number of established demon houses, a few of the more recent Great Houses (that haven't managed to, or bothered to actually grab [Black Zone](BlackZone) surrealestate), and there is an entire encleave of the New Ones, who are convinced that their society is better than that of Old Chaos.

All of which was lost when the wave wiped out Shadow.  Apparently there was an actual reason why it was desireable to be in the [Black Zone](BlackZone).

There are already tentative beginnings of reestablishing some of the businesses out there, and the bureaucratic offices, sinply from space concerns.
