 + Through [Laetatio](LaetatioOfRandom)'s Trump shields (and bad stuff), the swarm of demons that is now controlled by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) is transported to "places not threatening to Laetatio".  Many of these places are later revealed to be cross-reality.
 + [Zorro](ZorroOfAssassins), formerly the apprentice to [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins), kills [House Swayvill](HouseSwayvill).  [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) takes over the remnants of the house. [Log](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log990119.html#jeasway)

### (Killing [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), take 1)
 + [Realms Master Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) investigates the [Golden Circle Kingdom of Begma](GoldenCircleKingdoms), and wipes it to its foundation.  Angry at the situation with [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), Shiryu threatens to wipe reality clean and restart it if the problem isn't taken care of. [log](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log990706.html)
 + The [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) declare war on [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin), and [Silver Lyra](SilverLyra) steps down for a war king.  [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) is elected the wartime [King](KingOfChaos).
 + [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) unmakes [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover), and announces that she has allied with the other side for quite some time. [log](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log990803.html#sect2)
 + In two separate [Grey Sphere](GreySphere) incidents, first [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) and [the Warlord Marial](RealmsLords), and then [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) are trapped.  With difficulty, everone escapes.
 + The promontory later known as [Pride's Folly](PridesFolly) was invaded by a motley and powerful crew. [log 1](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log991026.html) [log 2](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log991109.html#sect3)  It was put in [Neville's](NevilleOfEric) hands for cleanup.  But somehow [Julian](JulianOfOberon) was the most recent controller.

   + [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) is killed through the efforts of multiple [Pattern](PrimalPattern) incarnations, [Pattern blades](PatternBlade), [Logrus blades](LogrusBlade), massive amounts of warfare, and some really good drugs.
   + [Neville](NevilleOfEric) is given the task of cleaning up [Gwen's](GwenOfDworkin) RealityMachine
