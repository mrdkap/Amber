The HamsterVerse is a promontory originally located via a rift from the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).  It was between the PC's local reality and [Vanir's Wrath](VanirsWrath), and the home of a massive manufacturing facility.

The HamsterVerse itself is a massive promontory, at least as large as a galaxy.  It includes multiple worlds with vast distances between them, many of which have science-fictional levels of technology.

There were a set of 17 Powers in the HamsterVerse, of which some are destroyed.  None of these powers are terribly impressive on the [Amber](KolvirPromontory) scale; they include creating loaves and fishes, and the use of a rope that climbs straight up.  In several cases, [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) is now the only wielder of these powers.

The HamsterVerse was contaminated with local [Pattern](PrimalPattern) through the Hamsterites, when [Hamster Dworkin](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#dworkin) drew a copy of the [Pattern](PrimalPattern) with a hamster-scale [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement).  This Pattern is located on the same planet the known rifts were on.  Part of a [Logrus Blade](LogrusBlade) brought by [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) fragmented off and formed a diffuse astronomical body, creating a Nebula [Logrus](TheLogrus) to balance the new Pattern.

There is more information on the [Hamsterites](WhoIsWhereHamsterites).
