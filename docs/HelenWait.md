## Helen Wait

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Helen is a tall shapely red-head. She is almost always immaculately
dressed for whatever the occasion. She has a knack for knowing just
the right level of socially appropriate under just about any
circumstance. She is seldom unarmed, and considered an excellent
marksman with pistol or thrown weapons, and has been quite successful
in the field of improvized weaponry. It might or might not be a rumor
that she disarmed someone by shoving the heel of her high-heel shoe
through the trigger guard (and the hand holding said pistol), while
distracting them, by reaching down to take off the other one.  She is
the (very effective) receptionist at [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s gym.

People who have issues, or want to sell things to the gym are often
told to go to Helen Wait.
