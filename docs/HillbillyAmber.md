An alternate reality where [Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy) drew the [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern).  A jealous [Dworkin](HillbillyDworkin) slew his brother, then realized that he could never walk the pattern.  A few litters with the [(female) Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber) later, the mud flats of Hillbilly Amber were populated by scary inbred Amberites.

[Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) drew a pattern in a bottle above the grave of [Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy), bringing him back to life as the ectoplasmic ghost, often referred to as [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy).  [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) also found the rift connecting Hillbilly Amber to the [Evil Amber](EvilAmber), leading to [Technically Evil Flora](EvilFlora) killing [Hillbilly Brand](HillbillyBrand), and [Hillbilly Dworkin's](HillbillyDworkin) protracted and eventually successful fight with [Evil Oberon](EvilOberon).

Every rational individual who has visited that universe, including the local [Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy) and [Deidre](HillybillyDeirdre), have left and tried to never return.

Those familiar with the Hillbilly reality optimistically hope it has been destroyed.
