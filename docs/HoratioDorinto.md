## Horatio "Horrorshow" Dorinto

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Current leader of the [Alpha Team](DrashirStrikeTeams).

Specially trained to be Alpha leader by [Drae](DrashirBlitzen) and
[Millie](MaximillianMastersonIII), Horatio earned his call sign by the
steely calm he can maintain on a mission. Through explosions and
intense gunfire, Horatio can keep a peaceful and focused demeanor ...
until the time for calm ends. Then Horrorshow is at the front of the
pack, guns blazing, using whatever he can to defeat the enemy. One of
the most impressive things he can do is pause that rage at a second's
notice at Drae's command.
