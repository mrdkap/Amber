The [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [House](ChaosHouses) (formerly known as) Barimen made an active claim that all descendants of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) were members of its house.  This claim annoyed [Shiryu](RealmsLoardShiryu) sufficiently that he unmade the house. (It might have been more complicated than that, but, from the outside, that's how it appeard.) It is physically impossible for anyone to say the phrase "House Barimen" within the confines of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).

One of the interesting talents of this now defunct house was that they were the creator of some very interesting place-trumps, based on a number of things that were not paintings, but objects.  They worked very much as "portal keys." Basically you touched them and let the desitnation that they were broadcasting fill your mind, and you would step through and be there.  This was after one of themr members ([Darkstar](DarkStar)) managed to get all (people) trumps banned in Chaos.  It is rumored that since these weren't pictures, or of people they weren't actually "trumps" and yet, that's exactly what they were.  They were also in competition with the Ways And Means Committee, so, depending on how politics went, these methods of travel were either very popular or not mentioned in polite society.  It is thought that the art got lost with the house.

There are (presumably) still many survivors of the house, and some are known to have joined other [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [Houses](ChaosHouses) such as [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight) and [House Cara](HouseCara).
