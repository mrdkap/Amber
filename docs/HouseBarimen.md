The [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [House](ChaosHouses) (formerly known as) Barimen was the house that [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber), [Darkstar](DarkStar), Cornelius the Great, and [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen) came from in their day.

Barimen made an active claim that all descendants of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) were members of its house.  This claim annoyed [Shiryu](RealmsLoardShiryu) sufficiently that he unmade the house. (It might have been more complicated than that, but, from the outside, that's how it appeard.) It is physically impossible for anyone to say the phrase "House Barimen" within the confines of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).

There are (presumably) still many survivors of the house, and some are known to have joined other [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) [Houses](ChaosHouses) such as [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight).
