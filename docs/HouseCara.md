The major house of Chaos for which [Delta House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/) is merely a shadow.  House Cara is the party house of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), and a party has been going on continuously for quite some time.

It was one of the surviving outposts of the demon-wave covering [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) and had the honor of [having Jesby formally surrender to them](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log970819.txt).

Of course, the party had to move when the physical house picked up a [Variable Pattern infection](VariablePattern), and, for a while during [Toram's](ToramOfMages) invasion, the house was relocated to [Suhuy's Ways](SuhuysWays), but the party kept going on.

These days, the physical house includes four [Old Lords](OldLord), trapped by the [Pattern](Primal Pattern) probably after becoming a bit too close to the refreshments and getting stuck in the plumbing.

[Vlad](VladOfCara) (no longer pattern-stapled to things) is the house head, although [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) keeps him pickled in alcohol in [Suhuy's Ways](SuhuysWays) for safekeeping.  [Yuri](YuriOfCara) is the house second and takes care of what day-to-day business there is.

### Notable Members:
 + [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) is positive that there have never been, nor will there ever be notable members of House Cara.
