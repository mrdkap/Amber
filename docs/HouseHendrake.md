[House](ChaosHouses) Hendrake had a long-standing, house-wide vendetta against those in [Amber](ShadowKolvir).  Some say that this is because of a set of prophesies about them being removed from Chaos and systematically killed by the [King of Amber](KingOfAmber).

[Borel](BorelOfHendrake), using his position in the [Warriors](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds), became [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos) and used that position to declare war on [Amber](ShadowKolvir).

This lead to several actions, including the kidnapping at torture of [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) hoping to use him as part of the plot to bring down [Amber](ShadowKolvir), the attempt by [Lintra](LintraOfHendrake) to remake the prophesy, by seducing [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) to try and put their child [Triumph](TriumphOfBenedict) (and then later children or grandchildren) on the [throne of Amber](KingOfAmber), and [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict) doing all that she did, and the last, "do or die" attack on [Amber](ShadowKolvir) near the end of [Pattern Fall](PatternFall).

Claimed by [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) by "Right of Conquest", after he took the remains of the house by force. Thus making the house a target of the enemies of [Snarsht](SnarshtOfBeastmasters).  These enemies so descrated it that it is now abandoned, all but in title.

All of these activities had the house reduced from a [Major House](ChaosHouses) to a completely empty Minor House thus, proving the prophesy.

### Notable Members:
 + [Borel](BorelOfHendrake) - [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos), guild second of the [Warriors](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds), Head of [House](ChaosHouses), and author of it's lowest point in it's history.
 + [Lintra the Hellmaid of Chaos](LintraOfHendrake) - One of the most successful generals for [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) in the [Pattern Fall War](PatternFall), Mother of [Triumph](TriumphOfBenedict), great-grandmother of [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict), mastermind behind the (failed) plot to subvert [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) to the House's needs.
 + [Triumph](TriumphOfBenedict) - The first in a series of decendents scheduled to try and take the [throne of Amber](ShadowKolvir).  Ultimately failed to evidence the necessary (first and foremost lack of [Pattern](PrimalPattern) allergy) traits.
 + [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict) - Played a central role in the latter section of the [Pattern Fall War](PatternFall), including successfully seducing [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) and using him to get her what she wanted, on many levels.
