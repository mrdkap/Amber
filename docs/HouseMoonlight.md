The newest [major house](ChaosHouses) of the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos), founded by [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) for her descendents after [the House formerly known as Barimen](HouseBarimen) tried to claim all of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber)'s descendants as house members.  Since then it has occasionally been known as a gathering foci for those of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber)'s blood.  For good or for ill.  Much to the occasional discomfort on all sides, tends to be allied with [Cara](HouseCara), [Swayvill](HouseSwayvill) (now that it is basically Jean), [Helgram](HouseHelgram) (now that it is in Amber), and [Hendrake](HouseHendrake) (now that it is basically Norton).

### Notable Members:
 + [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) is the house head
 + the [Archivist](TheArchivist) (an alternate [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) from [Vanirs Wrath](VanirsWrath)) is the house second.
 + [Zorro](ZorroOfAssassins), [Princess Chandra's](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) insane former apprentice
 + [Laetatio](LaetatioOfRandom)
 + Two [Randoms](RandomOfOberon), one local and one alternate.  [Random](RandomOfOberon) may have lost track which was which.
 + [Martin](MartinOfRandom) decided to join the house of his family, on his Father's side, although he does hang out at [Cara](HouseCara) a lot.
 + Some former members of a former house that sounded vaguely like Barimen

The physical house is surrounded by a moat of [marbles](GreySphere), and the house has been disinfected once by dragon fire (and survived the experience).
