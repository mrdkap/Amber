The newest [major house](ChaosHouses) of the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos), founded by [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) for her descendents after [the House formerly known as Barimen](HouseBarimen) tried to claim all of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber)'s descendants as house members.

[Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) is the house head, and the [Archivist](TheArchivist) (an alternate [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) from [Vanirs Wrath](VanirsWrath)) is the house second.  Other members of the house include:
 + [Zorro](ZorroOfAssassins), [Princess Chandra's](PrincessChandraOfAssassins) insane former apprentice
 + Some former members of Barimen
 + [Laetatio](LaetatioOfRandom)
 + Two [Randoms](RandomOfOberon), one local and one alternate.  [Random](RandomOfOberon) may have lost track which was which.

The physical house is surrounded by a moat of [marbles](GreySphere), and the house has been disinfected once by dragon fire (and survived the experience).
