House Swayvill is one of the 17 Major Houses of the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  House Swayvill rebelled in opposition to the established order, and was slaughtered single-handedly by [Zorro](ZorroOfAssassins).  (Well, he may have used two hands.)

After this, [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) inhabited the house, as well as the bodies of its members with any spark of life left. [Zorro's](ZorroOfAssassins) autograph, along with other interesting trinkets, rest on House Swayvill's mantel.

House Swayvill is insistent that it be ranked lower than [House Pharaban](HousePharaban).

House Swayvill is patrolled by [Jean Saucers](JeanOfFlorimel), usually supplemented by [Hamster Finndo](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#finndo), [Hamster Osric](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#osric), or [Hamster Corwin](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#corwin).
