Ilk's just this guy, you know?  Besides, the Logrus likes him.  I mean, even the Logrus is allowed a pet every now and again, right?

Among other things, Ilkandacian is a nephew of REN. Usually called Ilk. 
Ilk was the first in line for the [Major House in Chaos](ChaosHouses) [House Cara](HouseCara) (Vladiochi) until Vlad himself was rescued, and pronounced clean

Ilk is an accomplished sorcerer who has never the less spent a fair amount of time in a bucket after encountering 'force unrack' spells.

Currently Ilks are serving as:
* the [Serpent's Apprentice](RealmsLords)
* the [Logrus Babysitter in the form of Suhuy on the orders of the Serpent](RealmsLords) (All promotions are permanent, all demotion are permanent)
* Yuri, the third in line to [House Cara](HouseCara) 
* the apprentice to an [ectoplasmic variable-Pattern-based alternate Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy)
* a [Realms Lord titled "Savior of Chaos"](RealmsLords)
*  hanging out with [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) in a bonsai tree in [Shiryu's](RealmsLords) ways
* serving as off-site backup (or maybe a [Logrus Master](RealmsLords)) while hanging out with Ilaryn and studying the Logrus-nebula in a different reality.
