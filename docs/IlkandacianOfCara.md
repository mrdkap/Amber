Among other things, Ilkandacian is a nephew of REN. Usually called Ilk. Currently Ilks are serving as the [Serpent's Apprentice](RealmsLords), the [Logrus Babysitter in the form of Suhuy on the orders of the Serpent](RealmsLords), was the first in line for the [Major House in Chaos](ChaosHouses) [House Cara](HouseCara) (Vladiochi) until Vlad himself was rescued, and pronounced clean, the third in line to [House Cara](HouseCara) (Yuri), apprentice to an [ectoplasmic variable-Pattern-based alternate Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy), a [Realms Lord titled "Savior of Chaos"](RealmsLords), hanging out with [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) in a bonsai tree in [Shiryu's](RealmsLords) ways, and serving as off-site backup (or maybe a [Logrus Master](RealmsLords)) while hanging out with Ilaryn and studying the Logrus-nebula in a different reality.
