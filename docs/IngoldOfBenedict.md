## Ingold

Ingold is the eldest son of our local [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), and is by far the oldest of [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) grandchildren.  His power levels put several of the "Elder Amberites" to shame.

There are some issues between [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) and his son that are not public knowledge.

Ingold's line includes:
 + [Janus](JanusOfIngold) - Ingold's eldest son, born soon after his pattern inauguration.
   + [Gil](GilOfJanus) - [Janus's](JanusOfIngold) daughter
     + [Absalom](AbsalomOfGil) - [Gil's](GilOfJanus) son
   + [Calla](CallaOfJanus) - [Janus's](JanusOfIngold) daughter, 
 + [Nasirdin](NazirdinOfIngold) - Another son of Ingold, born in Shadow Earth when he had tried to use the Pattern to take him to Corwin, after Eric's abandonment of him.
   + [Al-Nazir](AlNazirOfNazirdin) - [Nasirdin](NasirdinOfIngold)'s son.

## Super Pattern:

 1. Find a way to grow very large, a la Alice in Wonderland or Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.
 1. Draw a very, very, large pattern.
 1. Use your powerful pattern and profit!

The Super Pattern was drawn by Ingold and was quite effective.  An incarnation was summoned against [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) during the battle against her in what became [Pride's Folly](PridesFolly).

Ingold wanted to undraw his pattern, and fed all of the power from it to [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie) during that entity's fight in Amber against [Evil Titania](EvilTitania) (previously identified as "[Evil Benedict's](EvilBenedict) Steed", or a "bunny out of nightmare".).  When the pattern was drained by Ingold, its creator, while he stood in the center maintaining a [Trump](TrumpDeck) contact to [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie), it vanished.  

Ingold vanished in a clap of lightning at that time, and all attempts to locate him have been fruitless.  Ingold is considered missing, and too resourceful to be dead (or to stay that way).

## Void

Ingold is considered a master of the [Void](TheVoid), a cross-shadow or possibly a cross-promontory connecting power.
