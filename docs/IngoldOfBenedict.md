## Ingold

Ingold is the eldest son of our local [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), and is by far the oldest of [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) grandchildren.  His power levels put several of the "Elder Amberites" to shame.

There are some issues between [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) and his son that are not public knowledge.

Ingold is responsible for the [Super Pattern](SuperPattern).

He also seems to be a [Void](TheVoid) adept.

Ingold's line includes:
 + [Janus](JanusOfIngold) - Ingold's eldest son, born soon after his pattern inauguration.
   + [Gil](GilOfJanus) - [Janus's](JanusOfIngold) daughter
     + [Absalom](AbsalomOfGil) - [Gil's](GilOfJanus) son
   + [Calla](CallaOfJanus) - [Janus's](JanusOfIngold) daughter, 
 + [Nasirdin](NazirdinOfIngold) - Another son of Ingold, born in Shadow Earth when he had tried to use the Pattern to take him to Corwin, after Eric's abandonment of him.
   + [Al-Nazir](AlNazirOfNazirdin) - [Nasirdin](NasirdinOfIngold)'s son.
