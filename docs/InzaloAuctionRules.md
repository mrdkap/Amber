## The Auction Rules

If you want your character to be, for example, a hotshot in mental
powers, then bid heavily in Psyche, but don't neglect Endurance.
Combat is determined by Warfare, the last auction, but a good warrior
should have some ranking in Strength and Endurance as well.

Here are the hard-and-fast rules of the Attribute Auction.

  1. All players start with 25 points.
  2. Every bid is permanent. Each player's highest bid is paid and can
     not, ever, under any circumstances be reduced or refunded. 
  3. Extra points can be gained by making contributions.
     Contributions are some kind of regular, on-going chore, or
     enhancement to the game that the player promises to do for the
     campaign.  Examples include keeping a diary for your character,
     taking notes for the whole group, or drawing art (trumps?) for
     the characters.
 4. Players can only bid for themselves.  It's just not fair to the
     other players.  If missing players want to participate, the GM
     will stand as proxy.  But since the bid is going to be over
     discord, and asynchronous, it shouldn't be hard for the bidding
     rounds to happen.
 5. The winner of an Attribute Auction is unbeatable by everyone else
     on their ladder.  Until enhancement points are distributed, and
     possible new rungs are established, whomever wins for an
     Attribute is that Attribute's ultimate winner.  First place is the
     only safe place.  If you get first place in any Attribute
     Auction, you will know you are the best of your ladder.  Anyone
     after the Auction, can buy up, even spending as many points as
     the first place winner, but they can never beat, or equal
     whomever gets first place, until a new rung is established.  And
     the first place winner always has the right to buy up, first, if
     they are about to be surpassed.
  6. Ranks are based on the Attribute Auction.  Each group of player
     really sets up their own ladder and therefore their own levels
     for advancement.  With your bids you are making the rank system
     for this section of this campaign.  What you bid will determine
     how the campaign will be set up.  The final results also
     determine how characters advance later on.
	 
	 Here's how it works.  Assume the final results for Warfare turns
     out to be fifth place for 10 points, fourth place for 15 points
     third place for 19 points second place for 20 points and first
     place for 22 points.  That means buying up Warfare later will
     have to match those point levels, just ad if they were rungs on a
     ladder. You couldn't possible spend 18 points in Warfare.  You
     have to "match" the bidders who bid in the Auction, so you can
     only spend 15 or 19, but nothing in between.
	 
     The initial ladder may have people tied for a place, so there
     might be 3 people at 19 points.  This is just fine.  Until people
     buy up. If you do go up the rung, you will be listed as 3.5 or
     2.5 or the like so that the actual 3rd or 2nd rank person can
     still beat you, since they had that rung from the beginning, but
     ... they might also have bought up at the time you are buying
     up. 
	 
  7. There is some small adjustments by buying either
     [Bad Stuff](GoodBadZeroStuff) or Enemies (not currently
     available), or the like.  While this is a possibility, it is not
     necessarily the best path.  But that choice is always yours. 
	 
## How an Auction Works

  1. The attribute is described.  To make sure everyone knows how
     important this attribute is.
  2. Everyone privately writes the GM with their opening bids.  These
     bids, like any others, can't be taken back.  The main point is to
     allows everyone an equal chance to get in a bid before things go
     crazy.  "No bid at this time," is a completely acceptable bid.
  3. When everyone is done the first tentative ladder will be
     published.
  4. Second (and subsequent) rounds of bids then will be solicited.
     One cannot lower one's bid, only raise it.  One can only bid at
     the ladder's rungs, except for the top rung.  That can keep going
     up.
  5. Once no more changes are submitted, the bidding is closed, and
     the ladder is published.  The people associated with each rung
     might or might not be known.  (It is highly likely you will know
     your own rungs, for example, but you won't know if they are
     shared, and, if so, with whom.)
