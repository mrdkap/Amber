Son of [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) and [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers). Half-brother to [Silver Lyra](SilverLyra), [Jackie](JackieOfFlorimel), [Connor](ConnorOfFlorimel), and [Amaranth Sinclair](AmaranthOfFlorimel).

Multi-homed eternally five-year-old master of [Un-Life](UnLife).  The Prophet of (Auntie) [Verra](DemonGoddessVerra) and the [Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber).  Steward of [Amber](KolvirPromontory). Head of [House Swayvill](HouseSwayvill).  Apprentice to [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) (in the Jester's Guild of Amber.)  Former [Realms Lord](RealmsLords).

Jean was born approximately ten (fifteen?) years ago by the Amber clock, but walked the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern) when he was five.  His thought processes have evolved since then, but he cannot be said to have "grown up". A shadow of his old coloring book can be found [here](Jeans-Coloring-Book).

Prominent Jeans:
 + Primal Jeans - Jean's original body, and a second body reshaped by the [Pattern](PrimalPattern) and [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) to be the same as the original.  The second body was once a [Logrus](TheLogrus) master, but this hardly matters except when Jean is stoned.
 + [Uber-Mjolnir](PatternBlade) - a pattern hammer imported from the [Uber-Verse](UberVerse) by [Uber-Merlin](UberMerlin). Appropriated by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) from [Uber-Merlin](UberMerlin), budded into by Jean after [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) destroyed [Variable-Pattern Mjolnir](PatternBlade).  Created by various [Fionas](FionaOfOberon), [Mjolnirs](PatternBlade) are sharp pattern-hammers that act as psyche-to-warfare converters.
 + Mecha-Jean - Fifty stories high, made of stone, and [Variable-Pattern](VariablePattern)-powered thanks to [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy).  Mecha-Jean is usually found protecting the [Paths of the Dead](DragaeraPromontory) 
 + Swayvill - the head of [House Swayvill](HouseSwayvill) is the Jean with the appropriate ring 

 + Saucer Jean - present in quite a number of promontories and alternate universes. The saucers were originally born out of an escape route built by [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) to get out of [Norton's](NortonOfBeastmasters) [head](NortonsHead), and were based on Ilk's primal (plasma toroid) form.
   + Barcajeans are sets of saucers that are joined by tractor beams to form the outline of a reclining easy chair. They are a more? comfortable form of transit than just being dragged along by saucers.
 + Torcs - Saucers that have shapeshifted to have a hole in the center.  Torcs are generally worn by priests of the [Demon Goddess Verra](DemonGoddessVerra), which tends to cut down on heresy because the torcs can always shift "back" to saucers.
 + Homonculi Jeans - small [unalive](UnLife) homonculi.
 + Tanks - [unalive](UnLife) tanks built by Jean populate the [Hamsterverse](HamsterVerse) as a sea, and a contingent was moved to the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) to defend it.  It is unclear how many tanks survived [Julian's](JulianOfOberon) invasion, repelled by [Warlord Marial](RealmsLords).
 + Mattress Jeans - the original brain-eating model, based on a primal form of a [Helgramite](HouseHelgram) shifter pricked by a super-[morganti](MorgantiWeapon).  Deprecated because of how antisocial brain-eating is, although it was effective on the sea of [demons](ChaosDemon) infesting the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  Also non-optimal because it ages and actually needs to eat.
 + Demon Jeans - some homonculi are still piloting their demon bodies, created during [Toram's](ToramOfMages) invasion of the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).
 + Penta-Jeans - Sets of 5 Jean, all coordinated.  Usually made up of Demon Jeans.

Notable allies:
 + The fish - a Trumpish fish that can swim through Jean, and provide transit from one Jean to another. Limited to those able to shapeshift into a fish-compatible scale and shape.
 + Jean-Whale - the Giant Whale that sometimes serves as transport for those who can't fit in a fish.
 + [Whagons](DragonWhales) - when a whale loves a dragon very much...
 * [Hamsterites](WhoIsWhereHamsterites) - since being in on their inception, both Jean and the Hamsterites feel very loyal to each other and often help out each other.  And the Hamsterites fit in a fish.

Locations:
 + One Primal Jean used to be Steward of [Amber](KolvirPromontory), and [Uber-Mjolnir](PatternBlade) was his gavel.  Disappeared when [Evil Benedict](Evil Benedict) invaded.  Might be lost somewhere in Tir.
 + Mecha-Jean is protecting the [Paths of the Dead](DragaeraPromontory) for Jean's aunt, [Demon Goddess Verra](DemonGoddessVerra).
 + Two Penta-Jeans of Demons escort and attempt to bodyguard [Faythe](FaytheOfCeleste) and [Felice](FeliceOfCeleste). 
 + Swayvill is in his [House](HouseSwayvill).

Jean survived the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge) relatively unscathed because of his extremely high warfare when Maximilian was wielding [Uber-Mjolnir](PatternBlade).
