## Jenny Johnson

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Jenny is friendly, although somewhat nieve, at times, and tends to
make friends in some of the oddest places.  She really does like
helping out, and understands that most other people are not as smart
or fast as she is, so she makes allowances.

Due to her connection to [Amelia](AmeliaJohnson) and Beth, she charges
most things to the museum that they all work for.  She also doesn't
draw a salary from the museum, but regularly makes donations, when she
gets paid or gets gifts from folks for the things she does.

She has a knack for 3d visualization, and tends to print dioramas and
the like of her, Amelia, and Beth's favorite battles, historical
sites, or other museum projects.

She is also very good at getting into things that exist in the
electronic world.

She also counts [Chumley](ChumleyMetrodora) and
[Millie](DrashirStrikeTeams) as her close friends.

She has found her "voice" it is somewhat similar to a combination
of Amelia and Beth, with just a touch of Millie thrown in.
