The Jewel of Judgement was once the eye of the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos).  The [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) only has one eye at large; all Jewels are linked.  (It's all [Mathematics](PowersBalancesAndOpposites#mathematics), as [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) would say.)

The Jewel is apparently the repository for [Amberite](WhoIsWhereAmberites) souls; everyone else's souls go into the support for the [promontory](Cosmology). In some places that means those souls enter scales of the local Wyrm, in others they become food for the local Kraken.  There is some speculation that the entire eye-stealing incident may have been motivated by getting a better view after the universe ends.  The Jewel, fortunately or unfortunately, acts as a sort of "soul velcro", making it simple for the [Court Necromancer of Amber](NortonOfBeastmasters) to yank souls out of it and return [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites) to life.

Although there is only one Jewel, there are several [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites) who have it.

 1. [Neville, aka King Eric II](NevilleOfEric) had the Jewel as given to him by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), formerly on the mantel at [House Swayvill](HouseSwayvill).  It is presumed that that instance is no more, after the Pattern Redraw Incident.
 1. [King](KingOfAmber) [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) has one around her neck, as she is off to deal with a possible [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) contingency/resurrection plan.
 1. [Hamster Dworkin](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#dworkin) has a Hamster-scale Jewel, which has briefly been in [Norton's](NortonOfBeastmasters) eye, completely saning him for the nonce.  It is said that that is forbidden from happening again.
 1. Bucephalus, [Malachai's](MalachiOfCorwin) horse, has a Jewel, on his chest harness.
 1. Both [Janus](JanusOfIngold) and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) have been known to walk around with (the same set of) half a dozen Jewels.  (Where is this set now?  No one seems to know.)

Despite rumors otherwise, there is no Frog of Judgement, no matter what the lineage of the BobaFrogs, and the Frogdalorean armor might claim.
