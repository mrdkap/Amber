Son of [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), but raised by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), as [Ingold's](IngoldOfBenedict) younger brother.

He has gone by "Sir Erik" for much longer than anyone has called him Johann, he is much more likely to answer to that than "Johann".

He has several curses, one is that Benedict just can't perceive him (and, yet some think that a blessing) his donkey, and he can't stay in any place for a long period of time. Possibly due to his habbit of talking to everyone, and everything, incessantly.

He is, despite his ways, quite skilled at combat.

Sir Erik's donkey is apparently indesctructable, and able to (and has a tendency to) eat anything and everything.

He has not yet been able to talk anyone into his bed that his donkey hasn't tried to eat, so, as far as anyone can tell, not only doesn't he have any offspring, but he might still be a virgin.
