Younger son of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) by Rilga, [Zack's](ZachariasOfJulian) and [Ivy's](IvyOfJulian) neglectful father, (although, it was a different promotory's Julian that begat [Ivy](IvyOfJulian)) and a doofus. De-nose-d by a combination of PCs in Norton's body; nose is currently believed to be somwhere dusty, probably in Pearl. Died, for the good of Amber (after invading it) much to [Zach's](ZachariasOfJulian) dismay.  Didn't trust his troops to be more than a simple extension of him, suborned various rangers in various [shadows](ShadowPlaces) to worshiping him (and his spare armor and Hell Hounds) as a G-d, including [Elisabella](ElisabellaOfRangers).

It is unclear if he was at all a creator of things, from his armor, Morgenstern, his horse, and the Hell Hounds, or he just knew where to get such good work done.
