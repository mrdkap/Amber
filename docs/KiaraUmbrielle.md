## Kiara Umbrielle

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Kiara, a vivacious woman standing tall at 5'6" with sun-kissed pale
skin and an attitude that captures your attention, is a walking
paradox. Her silvery blonde hair, streaked with vibrant hues like
amethyst and sapphire, reflects a rebellious spirit, while her caramel
eyes holds an intelligence honed by overcoming obstacles. She moves
with the easy grace of someone comfortable in her own skin, a subtle
swagger born from years of facing challenges head-on and emerging
victorious. Whether clad in practical cargo pants and a well-worn nerd
tee, or a goth dress accessorized with scavenged treasures, Kiara
exudes an aura of quiet confidence that draws people in and leaves
them wondering what adventure she might embark on next.  You never
know where she might appear next: a night market in Samarkand, dancing
by the fire with the Romany, or wandering through the wonders of
Istanbul.  Having grown up on stories of the past, Kiara found her
calling as a rare book dealer, where each discovery felt like cracking
a secret code and each acquisition, a victory won through knowledge
and action.  Drawn to forgotten corners of history and fueled by a
military family's resilience, she thrives on finding unconventional
solutions, driven by a desire to conquer any challenge with a
mischievous grin and a mind brimming with creative solutions.
