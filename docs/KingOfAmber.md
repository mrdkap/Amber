A record of those who have ruled [Amber](KolvirPromontory):

(This sequence might not be totally right, and should be checked.)

 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), who took various queens and had a tendency to skip out every so often.
 + [Eric](EricOfOberon), who assumed the Regency then the Crown during the [Pattern Fall War](PatternFall).
 + [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), who took over as a new Regent after [Eric](EricOfOberon) died nobly for the good of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir).
 + [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), again, after the [Pattern Fall War](PatternFall).
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) took over as Regent after [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) mysteriously disappeared, again.
 + [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys) was asked by [Malachi](MalachaiOfCorwin) to keep an eye on things while he was gone (and he never returned), and was considered the Regent to the Regent.
 + Two of [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) ex-queens jointly and briefly held formal court in Amber: [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) and [Damia, aka Queen Paulette](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana).
 + [Evil Benedict](EvilBenedict) disrupted that court and was the de facto ruler of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber) for some years, having killed anyone and anything near the castle. The [Courts](CourtsOfChaos) considered [Faythe](FaytheOfBrand) (the heir to the regent for the regent) as the King of Amber in Exile.
 + After [Evil Benedict's](EvilBenedict) departure, [Hamster Oberon](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#oberon) and [Hamster Gerard](WhoIsWhereHamsterites#gerard) acted as custodians of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir).
 + [Neville, or "Eric II"](NevilleOfEric) claimed the kingship and was acknowledged as King by the Crown itself, and also by the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).  Later, Neville killed [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) in personal (but not single) combat.
 + When [Neville](NevilleOfEric) died, heroically redrawing the pattern with [Auricle](AuricleOfTir) during (and causing the end of the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge), the throne was once again vacant.  When following the royal line, [Neville](NevilleOfEric) was the only known living heir of [Eric](EricOfOberon) and had no heirs himself, and [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon)'s line having thinned out - or having declared for [Corwin's Promontory](CorwinPromontory) and therefore abdicating (perhaps in haste) their possible inheritance of the Throne in Amber - the question of who was next was somewhat open.  There was a (mostly cordial) meeting to see who was going to be next.
 + [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) was given Kingship, when offered it by her peers, and was accepted as the next in line, as the eldest non-ablicated descendent of Oberon's first acknowledged Queen and Wife, [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma).
 + While [Deirdre](DeirdreOfOberon) and a large portion of her Court are off trying to stop the latest iteration of the [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) Resurrection Contingency, [Auricle](AuricleOfTir) has been appointed Regent.
