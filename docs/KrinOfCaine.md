## K'rin
Dead, saving [Caine](CaineOfOberon) and [Raven](RavenOfCaine). Daughter of [Caine](CaineOfOberon) and his wife.

K'rin personally killed with extreme predjudice any of the women [Caine](CaineOfOberon) was with, if they happened to get pregnant, as well as their children. Pirate. Believes she was the co-founder of the cross-shadow [Guild of Slavers](ChaosGuilds) not realizing that it was simply an expansion of the existing [Slavers Guild](ChaosGuilds). [Raven](RavenOfCaine)'s paramour (not knowing his parentage). Rumored to be part of the reason for [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s ban on intermingling between family members. No known children.
