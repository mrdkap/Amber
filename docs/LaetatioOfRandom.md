Laetatio is the son of [Random](RandomOfOberon) and [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins).  "Tate" is a magnet
for bad stuff and the father of [Caelin](CaelinOfAssassins); these two facts may not be unrelated.

An alternate Laetatio is the father of the alternate Caelin known as the Archivist. Or is the local Tate the father of both?  That is the sort of thing he would do.

Tate is a member of [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight) in the local
Chaos.
