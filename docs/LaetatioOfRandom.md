Laetatio is the son of [Random](RandomOfOberon) and [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins).  "Tate" is a magnet
for bad stuff and the father of [Caelin](CaelinOfAssassins); these two facts may not be unrelated.

An alternate Laetatio is known as the Archivist; he is a master of
Bibliomancy.

Both Tate are members of [House Moonlight](HouseMoonlight) in the local
Chaos.
