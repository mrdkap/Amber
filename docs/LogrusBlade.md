This is an actual forged blade, that has a power bound to it, in this case [Logrus](TheLogrus) Power.  The most known (and named) blade of this type is name "Reef" or "Reefs" and is held and wielded by [Raven](RavenOfCaine).

This is opposed to a blade made from a previously existing Logrus Master (someone in an equivalent role to [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy)) (as [Caine's](CaineOfOberon) blade "Shoals" apparently was), or a blade curdled out of [Logrus (or Serpent) energy](PowersBalancesAndOpposites), as [Ilk's](IlkandacianOfCara.md) unnamed blade seems to be.
