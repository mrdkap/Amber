One of the most populated and indiscriminant [guilds](ChaosGuilds) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  They don't require exclusivity and are willing to accept anyone who wants to learn and has any talent for what they teach whatsoever.

Recently there was a [bit of a turnover](ToramTheBigBad) due to the actiosn of the past [Guildmaster](ToramOfMages), and the continuing necessity of his [replacement](JenoirOfMages).

[Jenoir](JenoirOfMages) managed to pass the guild meaningfully, and successfully to [Amaranth](AmaranthOfFlorimel) as Guild Master and the [Bear Mage](BearMage) as guild second.

The new guild heads are currently rebuilding, with some help from [Ferethyn the Realms Mage](RealmsLords), and some of the folks from [Cobalt](CobalteanRoyalFamily).

One of their ongoing tasks is to hunt down and eliminate any taint of the [former Guildmaster](ToramOfMages).
