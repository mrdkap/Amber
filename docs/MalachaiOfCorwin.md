Malachi is recognised as [Corwin's](CorwinOfOberon) son, though his parentage is unknown. He was a foundling who became a captain and served with distinction in His Majesty's Second Imperial Lancers, and was captured and tortured during PatternFall.

Get to know Malachai through <a href="https://github.com/mrdkap/Amber/blob/master/Malachais_journals.md">his journals</a>, the only record of the early days of the game.

Malachi is known for his sword Galantine (crafted by Tazik) and his horse Bucephalus. Galatine is not a pattern blade - but darned close. Bucephalus one of the four parents of one of the Cobalteans (it's complicated).

Malachai was appointed Warden of [Arden](ForestOfArden) by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), and was recognized as Regent after [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) disappearance.  The Crown seemed to be going out of his way to make him King, but he successfully avoided that fate.

Malachi has been told that he's not supposed to be here yet.
