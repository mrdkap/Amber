## Marcus Umbrielle

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Born in 1968. Deceased at age 42 in 2010.  Survived by wife
[Nova](NovaUmbrielle) who he married in 1988 and children
[Kiara](KiaraUmbrielle) born in 1990 and Elrond born in 1994.

Decorated Marine sniper.  Enlisted in 1986, after the West Berlin
discotheque bombing. Two Purple Hearts (the second awarded
posthumously), Navy Distinguished Service Cross, Joint Service
Commendation, Bronze Star, among others.

His first Purple Heart was granted in the incident that put the plate
in his leg.  While most of that operation is still classified, it is
known that he lashed a bit of helecopter tail-blade to his own leg so
he could drag his spotter to safety, and medivac for them both, while
under fire.
