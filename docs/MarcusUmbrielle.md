## Marcus Umbrielle

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Deceased.  Survived by wife [Nova](NovaUmbrielle) and children
[Kiara](KiaraUmbrielle) and Elrond.

Decorated Marine sniper.  Two Purple Hearts (the second awarded
posthumously), Navy Distinguished Service Cross, Joint Service
Commendation, Bronze Star, among others.

His first Purple Heart was granted in the incident that put the plate
in his leg.  While most of that operation is still classified, it is
known that he lashed a bit of helecopter tail-blade to his own leg so
he could drag his spotter to safety, and medivac for them both, while
under fire.
