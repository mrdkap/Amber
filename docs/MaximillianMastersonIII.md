## Maximillian "Millie" Masterson III

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Current leader of the [Bravo Team](DrashirStrikeTeams).

If there is anyone to be considered [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s second in
command, It's Millie. His call sign comes from a joke. (He once said
he does not feel like a "Max" and was nicknamed "Millie" by Drae one
night over drinks, and it stuck.) Of course, like all good call signs,
the man is anything but. Focused, capable, and good at reading people,
Millie has a kind and joyful demeanor known to shake
[Drae](DrashirBlitzen) out of multiple slumps. The stories say that
Millie was one of the first soldiers to sign up with
[Drae](DrashirBlitzen) once his military consulting business has a
tactical field division. While only the two of them know for sure, no
other member of any other team knows of a time when Millie wasn't
here. It was because of [Drae](DrashirBlitzen)'s need to occasionally
be in two places at once that he redesigned the Bravo team and made
his previous Alpha leader their commander.

Every other team leader has served under him at one point or another,
before they made lead.
