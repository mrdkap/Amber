An [overpowered alternate-reality Merlin](UberMerlin) was the last survivor of the alternate Amber known as the [UberVerse](UberVerse). UberMerlin has not been seen in some time, but Oberon was found to have his Pattern-artifacts but not his staff.

Since this is a first-series-canon game, there has not been any appearance
of GhostWheel, Despil or Jurt.
