Youngest son of [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) and [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover). Raised by Clarissa without Oberon's knowledge, because he screwed up the other ones.  Hated his mother.  Haaated her.  HAAAAATED HER.

Mikail apparently fled local reality on Dalkantyr, but returned to seek control of [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory) and cause trouble. 

Recently <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log021001.html">killed</a> (or pent, depending on your perspective) by a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log020924.html">horde of PCs and NPCs</a> after he annoyed [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log020625.html#sect5">almost unraveling all of shadow.</a>  Significantly more power was brought to bear on Mikail than on [Amber](ShadowKolvir) during PatternFall, or somewhat later against [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) himself.
