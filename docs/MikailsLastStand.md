A promontory used by [Mikail](MikailOfOberon) as a base of operations. [Osric](OsricOfChanicut) dragged the promontory adjacent to a then-deserted [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory).

The aftereffects of the battle left a vast pile of [marbles](GreySphere) on the promontory.  [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) has been known to get pissy about this.

The sole native inhabitant of this promontory is a naive goddess, who has been left with two [Grey Spheres](GreySphere) she fished out of the [Sea Of Chance](SeaOfChance).
