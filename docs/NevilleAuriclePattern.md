A new, unblemished [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern), drawn to replace the one that was originally drawn by [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber), damaged by various of his descendents, and erased by [Ferro](FerroOfDworking).

Part of the reason why it was redrawn was to reestablish [Shadow](ShadowPlaces) after the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge) happened.

This pattern is said to still belong to the "Bloodline of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber)" and, on [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin)'s assurance, before [Deidre](DeidreOfOberon) could become [King of Amber](KingOfAmber) she proved her worth by walking it in a small, private, family-only ceremony.

This pattern is much more complex than the one [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) drew, mostly because it had three authors, none of which think similarly.  Reflections of it are much harder to come by, at the moment, although, that might change over time, as it begins to influence reality more and more over time.

Apparently, while completing the last few steps [Neville](NevilleOfEric) knew he wasn't going to survive the effort, so he put all of his last might into demanding and shaping compassion, especially for the [Golden Circle Kingdoms](GoldenCircleKingdoms), and for other [family members](WhoIsWhereAmberites) that some folks are ... less pleased about walking this pattern now.  Death curses might be strong, but Death Blessings, powered by a Pattern and a [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement) tend to be quite strong.
