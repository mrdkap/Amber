"Neville?  We named the broccoli Neville!"

Formally King Eric II of [Amber](KolvirPromontory), never known as "Eric Junior", usually known by his alias "Neville" or his title "the Great Protector".

Neville entered the game at a party [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) threw in [Castle Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber), which led to his surviving more than five minutes.  Over time, he proved to be the least obnoxious member of [House Helgram](HouseHelgram), and so his bid for control of the house was supported - or at least not opposed - by [Chaos's](CourtsOfChaos) power structure.

Neville spent some significant time improving direct trade between the [Golden Circle Kingdoms](GoldenCircleKingdoms), and standing up for justice and reason, as the (disguised) "Great Protector".

While mentally attacking [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict) via a group Trump contact, Neville revealed himself to be the son of [Eric](EricOfOberon). Since Neville was the least objectionable person who actually wanted to be [King of Amber](KingOfAmber), almost everyone who cared supported his bid.

Neville is also the head of [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) (mostly through attrition), and after assuming a throne of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber) [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu) moved [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) to [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir).  This vastly decreased house dissent as well as house population.

Neville stayed in [Amber](KolvirPromontory) for some time, and worked on rebuilding both it, and the [Golden Circle Kingdoms](GoldenCircleKingdoms) by continuing his role as "the Great Protector", dealing with mentally unstable [Pattern](PrimalPattern)-twinkies, an influx of [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites), the loss of Shadow in the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge), and mysterious pattern growths.

Working with [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) and [Auricle](AuricleOfTir), Neville drew their own [Pattern](NevilleAuriclePattern) in place of the Ferro-erased [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern).  Sadly, he did not survive the process.
