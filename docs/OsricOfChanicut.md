Normally a short, cigar-smoking t-rex with a purple jacket.  Osric is ancient; [Dworkin's Osric](OsiricOfOberon) was named after him. Osric has long been a respected member of [House Chanicut](HouseChanicut). He is also know as the Saviour of House Chanicut.

A [pit diver](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) in the past, Osric discovered the [Fringe](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).  Osric became the Master of the Fringe, shepherding it through recent problems including infestation by [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) and rebooting.

Osric has access to [Fringe Power](PowersBalancesAndOpposites), which he normally manifests as a crystalline shield that is impervious to just about anything.

On the request of [Shiryu](RealmsLords), Osric stood for [King in the Courts of Chaos](KingOfChaos) and won by a large margin when [Shiryu's](RealmsLords) support was announced.  Osric is a reluctant king, and expected to step down as soon as [Silver Lyra](SilverLyra) is officially restored.

Osric was recently recognized as an [Old Lord](OldLord) (which [House Chanicut](HouseChanicut) had claimed for thousands of turnings) after towing [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory) across the [Sea Of Chance](SeaOfChance) so that it was adjacent to [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).

Osric is currently the guild second of the [Rimfishers Guild](ChaosGuilds#rimfishers), some say in recognition of the towing effort of a promontory.  [House Chanicut](HouseChanicut) has clamed that he was one long before the [Abyss](TheAbyss) existed.

Osric was the player character of one of the three players who have died since the run began.  Rest in peace, Andrew Gentile.
