A Pattern Blade is traditionally a weapon where the [Pattern](PrimalPattern) has been infused into the blade, although [Duncan](DuncanOfGerard) has a different smithing technique where the Patternness is the primary weapon.  Generally, these weapons are edged, but [Fiona](FionaOfOberon) managed to make a pattern hammer that is still sharp.

Known Pattern weapons are:
 1. The Sword of State - Was in the control of [Neville](NevilleOfEric) usually in the posession of The Grey Man, and therefore possibly subject to the summoning of the [Steward of Amber](JeanOfFlorimel).
 1. [Eric's](EricOfOberon) PatternBlade - Tied to the Pattern in Castle Amber. As far as is known, it's name might be "My Blade", since [Eric](EricOfOberon) was never that creative.  Was in [Neville](NevilleOfEric)'s posession and is now supposedly in [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) somewhere.
 1. [Uber-Merlin's](UberMerlin) Pattern artifact stash - suspected to have been shifted inside [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), and thus looted by [Neville](NevilleOfEric).  Might also be in [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) somewhere.
 1. Werewindle - Tied to the Pattern in Castle Amber.  On [Martin](MartinOfRandom), under a "Somebody Elses Problem" field of some kind.
 1. Greyswandir - Tied to Tir's Pattern. There should be three copies of Greyswandir floating around.  Two are local and were duplicated when [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) was duplicated on [The Spiral](TheSpiral), one is from an alternate Amber.
    1. [Sandy Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) has a Greyswandir.
    1. [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) has a Greyswandir, usually shapeshifted inside him.
    1. One of the Greyswandirs are missing, probably lost by the [Clown Prince](CorwinOfOberon) but might be in [Malachai's](MalachaiOfCorwin) possesion.
 1. Andauntrick - Tied to the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern).  Most recently wielded by [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin).
 1. Mjolnir, pattern hammers created by [Fiona](FionaOfOberon) as a psyche-to-warfare transmuter. Apparently various [Fionas](FionaOfOberon) have thought this to be a good idea, across Slices of Fruit.
    1. Local Mjolnir - budded into by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), infused with [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) by [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy), then destroyed by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) when it was used against him.
    1. Uber-Mjolnir - budded into by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) as a replacement for Local Mjolnir.  Currently the gavel of the [Primal Jean that is currently the Steward of Amber](JeanOfFlorimel).
    1. Variable-Pattern Mjolnir - Destroyed by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).  For some reason it had gopher teeth-marks on the handle.  It is unclear why.

[Duncan](DuncanOfGerard) created a large number of Pattern weapons and artifacts.

I believe the Pattern Blade brought to a duel by someone defeated by [Janus](JanusOfIngold) is still floating around, but I forget where.
