## Pattern Fall War

The Pattern Fall War is the events of the first series of books, which happen normally until near the end of the fifth book. This [Timeline of Events](http://zelazny.corrupt.net/ambtime.html) may help, although the second series is not canonical in this game. Note that the existence of the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern), and the effect of the Blood of Amber upon same, is not initially common knowledge, even among [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites).

 + The point that it diverges is recored in [http://www.train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/divergent_point.html](http://www.train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/divergent_point.html).
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) enlists in [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir)'s army, and becomes a Captain in His Majesty's Second Imperial Lancers.  He is captured by the forces of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), recognized as Real but without Pattern, and tortured by shapeshifters in [House Hendrake](HouseHendrake) for over a century.  He is freed after the defeat of the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos), but continues to have... issues... with shapeshifting.
 + At the large battle on the [bare spot](BareSpot) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) between [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir) and [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) kills [King](KingOfChaos) [Borel](BorelOfHendrake).

This leads to the [Early Days](EarlyDays) of the game.
