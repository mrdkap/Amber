The Philosophers [Guild](ChaosGuilds) is a guild devoted to philosophical questions, and as such the PCs know very little about it.

The [Sea of Thought](SeaOfThought) is composed of many former members of the Philosophers guild, and a few former guild heads.  The sea is currently the Guildmaster after a motally wounded Duchess Ilarion joined the [Sea](SeaOfThought) withhelp from some folks including [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara).

[Jance](JanceOfPhilosophers), former [King of Chaos](KingOfChaos) was the guild second for the Philosophers guild after [Pattern Fall](PatternFall), until replaced by Eudiche, upon the discovery of his death.
