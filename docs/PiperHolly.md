Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

A 40ish year old experienced zoo and rescue dog expert, out of
the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Liberty Township, Ohio. She took
over there 10 years ago, moving there from the Dallas Zoo and
Aquarium, Dallas Texas. The Columbus Zoo is known for having the
largest Congo habitat in the world outside of Africa.  She is
also known for some of her published papers, on the balance of
the various habitats that are maintained there.

Her advocacy and interest in rescue dogs stems from the sad story
around her deceased husband and son, which also was the reason
she moved from Texas at the time. Thankfully her in-laws had
passed on before then, so they never knew the untimely death of
their child and grandchild.  She has been estranged from her
parents for a while now.
