## <A NAME="promontories">Promontories</A>
A promontory is a solid bit in the [Sea Of Chance](SeaOfChance) - think of it as a mountain rising up out of primal Chaos and a safer place to build than the Sea itself.  A promontory is not shadow but a power located on a promontory may cast shadow.  See the [Cosmology discussion](Cosmology) for more theories.
* [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory), Now mostly [Greater Arden](GreaterArden) (formerly known as Amber), and what was left of the [Golden Circle Kingdoms](GoldenCircleKingdoms) but also includes [Primal Amber](PrimalAmber) where the [Primal Pattern](Primal Pattern) sits
* [Pearl](CorwinPromontory) - Which might not be reachable through Shadow again
* [Ygg](YggPromontory) - [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s first and only attempt at farming
* [Cobalt and the Fractal Realm](CobaltPromontory) - home of [The Spiral](TheSpiral)
* [The Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) (also an <a href="http://www.train-wreck.org/~dkap/Amber/chaos_info.html">outdated GM writeup</a>) and the attendant [Black Zone](BlackZone) and [Grey Zone](GreyZone) places surrounding.  The Chaos [Houses](ChaosHOuses) and [Guilds](ChaosGuilds) are seated there.
* [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory), and the associated Overworld. Now also contains the skinned and re-located Avalon-based world that is [Count Cagliostro](CountCagliostro)'s as a walled flat earth (thus finally vindicating some of the "Crazy" folk).
* [Dragaera](DragaeraPromontory), and associated Paths of the Dead.
* [Faerie](TitaniaOfFaerie) (although it may not be a promontory, no one has bothered to ask [Titania](TitaniaOfFarie)).
* The Gold Place - place where someone with the "Midas Curse" has been pinned underwater, and _everything_ is gold. And contagious.
* The Pink Place - A giant, swiss-cheese like block-maze with a variety of different conditions as you move through the maze.
* [The Garden](TheGarden) - Probably want to leave metal behind.
* The promontory of [Mikail's Last Stand](MikailsLastStand)

* [Earthsea](EarthSea), home of [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio)'s mother Circe
* The [Egg Place](EggPromontory)
* The cave where the [Dragon Council](DragonCouncil) meets - actually if you are not a dragon, probably not wise to go there, and if you are, probably only with an invitation.
* [Evil Amber](EvilAmber), a more powerful alternate Amberverse (presumed destroyed)
* the [Hamster-verse](HamsterVerse) - Warning, Sane Dworkin lives here.
* [Hell](HellPromontory) - A terrible place, which blocks most major powers

## <A NAME="Primal">Primal Areas</A>
* [The Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) - If you have to ask, you probably don't want to go there.
* [The Void](TheVoid) - The Void is a cross-shadow (possibly cross-promontory) connecting power.  It is also not a comfortable place to be, since is seeks to eradicate all who enter.
* the [Fringe](TheFringe) is a [cross-shadow transit mechanism](FringeGate) originally created by the Tehrmelern.  It is self-rebooting.  Its central control room may be a promontory, or may also just be made of the same that is neither shadow nor sea.
