Pride's Folly is the current name of the promontory housing [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin)'s laboratory and the RealityEngine.  Pride's Folly appears to consist of a mountain, a (currently devastated) valley, and an extensive underground laboratory.

Prior to [Gwen's](GwenOfDworkin) (first) fall, the reality had an other name.

After [Gwen's](GwenOfDworkin) fall, the promontory was assigned to [Neville](NevilleOfEric) for cleanup by [King Osric](OsricOfChanicut) but fell under [Julian's](JulianOfOberon) control.
