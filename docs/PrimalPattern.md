The Primal Pattern was still a secret, and it's successor still mostly is, and not known to most of the multiverse.  The Primal Pattern was originally scribed by [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) on the promontory [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory) with the [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement).  The creation of the Pattern also created [Shadow](ShadowPlaces). 

This is now the [Neville](NevilleOfEric)/[Auricle](AuricleOfTir)/[Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) Pattern. This is due to some interesting circumstanses including:
 + Amberite Blood spilled on it
 + the erasure by [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin)
 + re-drawing efforts by [Neville](NevilleOfEric) (who didn't survive the effort) and [Auricle](AuricleOfTir), who did

From <u>Sign of the Unicorn</u>:
> Continuing downhill, a sense of depth reemerged. The sea, now plainly visible off to the right, underwent a possibly purely optical separation from the sky, with which it seemed momentarily to have been joined in some sort of Urmeer of the waters above and the waters below. Unsettling upon reflection, but unnoted while in effect. We were heading down a steep, rocky incline which seemed to have taken its beginning at the rear of the grove to which the unicorn had led us. Perhaps a hundred meters below us was a perfectly level area which appeared to be solid, unfractured rock-roughly oval in shape, a couple of hundred meters along its major axis. The slope down which we rode swung off to the left and returned, describing a vast arc, a parenthesis, half cupping the smooth shelf. Beyond its rightward jutting there was nothing-that is to say the land fell away in steep descent toward that peculiar sea.

> And, continuing, all three dimensions seemed to reassert themselves once more. The sun was that great orb of molten gold we had seen earlier. The sky was a deeper blue than that of Amber, and there were no clouds in it. That sea was a matching blue, unspecked by sail or island. I saw no birds, and I heard no sounds other than our own. An enormous silence lay upon this place, this day. In the bowl of my suddenly clear vision, the Pattern at last achieved its disposition upon the surface below. I thought at first that it was inscribed in the rock, but as we drew nearer I saw that it was contained within it-gold-pink swirls, like veining in an exotic marble, natural-seeming despite the obvious purpose to the design.

The well-known reflections or copies of the Primal Pattern were:
 + The [Pattern](KolvirPattern) under Castle Amber on [that Mount Kolvir](KolvirPromontory)
 + The [Rebman Pattern](RebmaPattern), in Rebma
 + The [Pattern in the Sky](TirPattern), in Tir na nog'th

The reflections of the Pattern have not survived the PCs.
