The Psionicists [Guild](ChaosGuilds) has recently had a fairly bumpy past.

For many reasons, they are not overly popular, and yet, folks don't want to get on their bad side.

Previous Guild Heads include:
 + Imagio, who was very much known for his ability to create seamless and completely believable illusions.  Spun out of an imagination with a depth and attention to detail beyodn compare, some of the favorite places in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) evaporated upon his death.  One of the few ways people know he is really dead, rather than this just being another illusion.
 + Andron, one of the strongest mental presences known in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) he could reach depths of mind almost unbelievable, and manipulate both minds, and objects on micro-levels untracably.  He and his long-time love Jenoir, then head of the [Mages](MagesGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds), both gave up their lives in OldCatan so that the [Realms Mage](RealmsLords) [Ferethyn](RealmsMageFerethyn) might live.  Out of a sense of duty to the lost lives of Andron and Jenoir, [Ferethyn](RealmsMageFerethyn) now is spending some time making sure that what was left behind by them is given the support it needs.
 + Miryam is currently the Guild Head.  She seems to be very likable, even after you have left her presence.  This has disturbed some people, but she claims that it is not anything she is doing.
 + Lothien, often confused for anyone else, seems to have a "somebody else's problem" field up for the last little bit.  This is a deliberate action after some problems with the imposter members of the [Etiquette](EtiquetteGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds) otherwise, was one of Imagio's strongest apprentices and was following in his studies.
