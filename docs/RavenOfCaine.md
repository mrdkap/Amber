Son of [Caine](CaineOfOberon) and [K'rin's](KrinOfCaine) nanny. Born within a year or two of [K'rin](KrinOfCaine).

Raven was [K'rin's](KrinOfCaine) paramour. Long time second in command of [Caine's](CaineOfOberon) flotilla. Pirate. Master Member of the cross-shadow [Guild of Slavers](ChaosGuilds#slavers). Rumored to be part of the reason for [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s ban on family members intermingling.

Owns a [Logrus Blade](LogrusBlade) named "Reef", and held up quite well against the [Black Council](BlackCouncil).

Raven is know to be around and about, possibly off revenging [K'rin](KrinOfCaine). 

Is currently the guild second of the [Warriors'](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds). and working on some of the restructuring around that. Apparently several (recently past) members of the [Warriors'](WarriorsGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds) objected to an Amberite wielding a [Logrus Blade](LogrusZBlade), but there has yet been any follow-through beyond their deaths.

Father of:

Grandfather of:
 + [Paul](PaulOfFerenc) - a skatepunk, who is trying to take personal wheeled/snow/ice boards/skates to the level that his ancestors have taken boats.
