## Realms Master Shiryu (The Gardner)

One of the five [Realms Lords](RealmsLords) of the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).

''A very tall person with strange features and a bluish cast to his skin. His hair was perfect.''

Shiryu is the Gardener, and all of reality is his Garden.  He takes responsibility for all of the [promontories](PlacesToGo) - but not necessarily what is on them.

Shiryu has been unusually active locally:
 + Uncreating [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) after declaring her a traitor to reality.
 + Immobilizing [Caine](CaineOfOberon) in the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance).
 + Supporting [Osric](OsricOfChanicut)'s bid for [King in Chaos](KingOfChaos).
 + Keeping the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) from sliding off the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) during the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge) (It's hard to garden, if the garden is gone.)
