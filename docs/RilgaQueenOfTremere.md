Rilga, Queen both in terms of inheritance, and of her own right, as proof of her ruling the fleets, ruled long and well in [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms). She was unpartnered and unchallenged until [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) sought to bring [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms) into alliance with [Amber](KolvirPromontory). Tricked into accepting him as a partner (tricked because he never intended to stay) he left her with child, and treaty, and went back to marry [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover).

After [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) left [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) for the company of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) he went back to Rilga to soothe his ego. She accepted him back on her terms, managed two more children with him, across the years, and eventually was shunned by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), since Rilga was now "too old".

Rilga did have the delight of having her son [Caine](CaineOfOberon) acknowledged by [Oberon](OberonOfAmber) after he proved it by walking the pattern.  It is said that the sea flows through the veins of those of her line, which is why [Julian](JulianOfOberon) is looked upon as somewhat strange in his choice of the forest, instead of the sea.

Mother of:
 + [Caine](CaineOfOberon): ([Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) father) Born out of wedlock, but acknowledged, and recognized in both [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms) and [Amber](KolvirPromontory)
 + Adira: (Haveloek, king of the Pirates as father) Was Rilga's heir and the most recently recognized Queen of [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms). [Gerard](GerardOfOberon) and Adira have been known to coordinate well with each-other when the navies of the Golden Circle are called upon to fight for [Amber](KolvirPromotory).
 + Nemuel: (Kaito (Haveloek's Heir) as father) Deceased, died with honors as the last line of defence against the [Gwening](GwenOfDworkin) fighting right next to his father.
 + Gali: (Kaito as father) Is Adira's heir (until Adira has children of her own. and really hopes she would hurry up with that) but prefers to be out at sea, rather than ruling, or doing any of the heir's duties.  It is rumored that she might have a secret pirate's life.
 + [Julian](JulianOfOberon): ([Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) father) Born decently after Rilga's and [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin)'s wedding so there is no question about [Julian](JulianOfOberon)'s legitimacy.  Recognized in both [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms) and [Amber](KolvirPromontory)
 + [Gerard](GerardOfOberon): ([Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) father) A difficult birth, he was a very large baby.  It was uncertain for a while if Rilga would survive.  Recognized in both [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms) and [Amber](KolvirPromontory).
 
Acknowledged Grandmother of:
 + [K'rin](KrinOfCaine)
 + [Raven](RavenOfCaine)
 + [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian)
 + [Velaria](VelariaOfGerard)
  
Unacknowledged Ancestor of:
 + [Duncan](DuncanOfGerard)
 + [Ferenc Nadasdy](FerencNadasdyOfRaven)
 + [Paul](PaulOfFerenc)
 
 There is speculation that [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) specifically targeted [Tremere](GoldenCircleKingdoms) because of what Rilga meant to [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
