Daughter (and bed partner) of [Benedict](BenedictOfAmber) and [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover).

Brought into the world by [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) in [Darkover](DarkoverPromotory), unknown to Benedict.  In fact he only knew she was his daughter right before her voluntary leap into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) to protect those of [Ooberon's](OberonOfDworkin) blood with whom she was intimate from any consequences or wrath if who she was was to be found out.  One of Malachai and the color coded scary little girls, she is fondly remembered by many.

When not playing at being a serving wench in Amber, she was also known as Bridget (the fire goddess), Sharra (the chained fire goddess of [Darkover](DarkoverPromontory)) or Paprika (a member of the [Dancers](DancersGuild) [Guild](ChaosGuilds) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos)) where she was somewhat of a Nanny to [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) and [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers).

Slept with so many of the various Amberites (especially the redheads), that some of whom she didn't sleep with sometimes wondered if they needed to improve somehow.

No known offspring. Though not for (apparently) lack of trying.
