## Ryan

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Mostly just a voice on the phone (although it is suspected that he
might have been in the room with, or even talked with some of the
other folks in the past) who often has either information or requests,
and is happy to pay for both. Money shows up tracelessly in the
appropriate accounts.  There are also dead-drops set up, if physical
items or questions for him need to be sent.  He has a number of ways
of getting physical items to you, if that was what was arranged for.

He is human, so makes mistakes from time to time, but seems to have a
vast network of information or informants, and seems also to be on the
side of "good" or at least the self-interest of those who have had
contact, and he is always willing to own up to his mistakes, and
rectify things as best possible.
