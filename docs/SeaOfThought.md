When you get a whole bunch of philosophers in the [Guild](ChaosGuilds) who (literally) pool together to be able to explore their philosophic questions better, you get a multiminded bodiless sea that thinks (and communicates).

If you are at all of a philisophic bent, they even have a set of guest-houses where you can stay, and visit, and explore mentally with them.  Although they do have a low-level recruitment drive going on.  Most of the guild business is either done out of those guest-houses, or by the guild second (Eudiche) since the sea "doesn't get about much, lately".

An interesting store of memories, philosophies and worthwhile conversations, there is no current record of anyone voluntarily leaving the Sea after having joined.
