The Wyrm on which [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) rests, the source of the Eye of the Serpent (now the [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement)).  The opposite of the [Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber), possibly because of the whole losing an eye thing, possibly not. Pretty darn powerful, and pretty darn entropic. Not terribly active.

When things die in the local universe, they go into his [scales](SerpentScale).  ([Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites) go into the [Jewel](JewelOfJudgement).)

The Serpent's [manifestation in the sky](SerpentSky) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) was considered a sign of an impending apocalypse.  If the Serpent had not returned to [his place](SerpentsAntechamber) under [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), it would have settled into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance) and been destroyed.

The Serpent was injured by members of the [Black Council](BlackCouncil), and shifted position causing the [Shadow Purge](ShadowPurge).
