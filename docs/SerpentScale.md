## Like Scales of the Serpent... 

Although it is not common knowledge, the souls of dead things enter the support for the local promontory.  Usually, this means a Kraken or a Wyrm. The souls that enter a Wyrm become scales, with the size of the scale reflecting the power of the soul.

The [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) of [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) has been known to detach scales to assist with pickup or retention of particularly recalictrant or slippery souls.  So far, this has been done for [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) (after the second? time she was killed) and for [Caine](CaineOfOberon).  Ask [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) for details.

The [shadow(s?)](ShadowPlaces) formerly controlled by [Toram](ToramOfMages) were Scaled by dragons, trapping unalive [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) inside.
