It's just Shadow. The places that stretch from the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern) to the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) and wider, trapping other Primal places inbetween.  Like celophane across the top of a bowl of fruit caught in jello.

Shadow is the place where people keep their stuff, have friends, and the majority of beings have lived their lives.
