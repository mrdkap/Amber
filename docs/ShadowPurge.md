Shadow was created by the tension between Order and Chaos, as exemplifed by the [Pattern](PrimalPattern) and the [Logrus](TheLogrus), or perhaps between the [Unicorn](UnicornOfAmber) and the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos). Most promontories with opposing powers have them on the same edifice; Shadow is a rare thing in the multiverse.

During an attack by the [Black Council](BlackCouncil), the [Serpent](SerpentOfChaos) moved.  Shadow fell into the [Sea of Chance](SeaOfChance).  Most of the [Golden Circle Kingdoms of Amber](GoldenCircleKingdoms) and the [Black Zone of Chaos](BlackZone) fell onto the shores of those promontories, and survived in altered form.  Some portions of the [Grey Zone of Chaos](GreyZone) also survived, but many locations there were lost.

In the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos), the [Abyss](TheAbyss) slammed shut, blocking the most well-known [Fringe Gate](FringeGate).
