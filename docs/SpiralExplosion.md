The [Trump Unibomber](CelesteOfBleys) destroyed the [Spiral](TheSpiral) by disrupting a powerful magical ritual designed to expel [Toram](ToramOfMages) from [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters).  [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin) was the focus of the ritual, and was [Trumped](TrumpDeck) by [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys).  She powered through his blocks to leave a note in his pocket, and disrupted his concentration.  Boom.  Boom much.

Several [Cobaltean](CobaltPromontory) mages died and [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin) was blasted into fragments spread out over several [shadows](ShadowPlaces). [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) was freed from [Toram](ToramOfMages), and was duplicated at the end - including the items shifted into his body, [Greyswandir](PatternBlades) and [Dworkin's](DworkinOfAmber) [Trump Deck](TrumpDeck).
