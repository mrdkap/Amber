 1. Find a way to grow very large, a la Alice in Wonderland or Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.
 1. Draw a very, very, large pattern.
 1. Use your powerful pattern and profit!

The Super Pattern was drawn by Ingold and was quite effective.  An incarnation was summoned against [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) during the battle against her in what became [Pride's Folly](PridesFolly).

Ingold wanted to undraw his pattern, and fed all of the power from it to [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie) during that entity's fight in Amber against [Evil Titania](EvilTitania) (previously identified as "[Evil Benedict's](EvilBenedict) Steed", or a "bunny out of nightmare".).  When the pattern was drained by Ingold, its creator, while he stood in the center maintaining a [Trump](TrumpDeck) contact to [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie), it vanished.

Ingold vanished in a clap of lightning at that time, and all attempts to locate him have been fruitless.  Ingold is considered missing, and too resourceful to be dead (or to stay that way).
