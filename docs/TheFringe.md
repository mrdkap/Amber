Fringe energy is a [major power](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) that is opposed by "blucite".  It was originally created by the Tehrmelern and rediscovered by [Osric](OsricOfChanicut).

Access to the Fringe is handled by [Fringe "gates"](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).   Shadows contain Fringe gates, which can only be accessed by "Fringeworthy" creatures.  The criteria for being "fringeworthy" is unknown but generally about 1 person in 100,000 qualifies.

Each gate leads to a platform, and platforms are connected by long walkways.  Physics is weird on the Fringe.  The Fringe gains power when objects are thrown off the side of platforms or walkways, as those objects are accelerated away.  This is a convenient disposal mechanism.

Fringe power can also be used to create crystalline objects and shields. Â Fringe was developed by the Tehrmelern (speculated as a proto Ways and Means Committee), who were later destroyed by the shapeshifting Mellor.   The Fringe was rediscovered by [Osric of Chaos](OsricOfChanicut). See Also: [[1](https://www.tritacgames.com/Fringeworthy.html)] [[2](http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fringe.html)]

There are multiple levels of authorization, encoded into command crystals.  At least two of the higher levels were patched into the original system and must be re-added after reboots.
