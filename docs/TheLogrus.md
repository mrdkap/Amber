[The Courts](CourtsOfChaos) have a sort of equivalent [to the [Pattern](PrimalPattern)] called the Logrus. It's a kind of chaotic maze. Keeps shifting about. Very dangerous. Unbalances you mentally, too, for a time. No fun.

The Logrus actually alters itself, constantly. Still, it's more angular, while [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon)'s [Pattern](CorwinPattern) is mostly curves and bends.

It's thought by some that other Slices of Fruit are available via the (in)correct walking of the Logrus.  Not only is this dangerous from a walking of the Logrus point of view, but also from the unknowns at the destination.
