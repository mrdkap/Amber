The Void is a cross-shadow (possibly cross-promontory) connecting power.

[Fiona](FionaOfOberon) is believed to have used Void when transporting [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) to the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern) in _Hand of Oberon_:

> I entered a cleft in a hillside. The way was narrow and very dark, with only a small band of stars above us. Fiona had been manipulating Shadow while we had talked, leading us from Ed's field downward, into a misty, moorlike place, then up again, to a clear and rocky trail among mountains. Now, as we moved through the dark defile, I felt her working with Shadow again. The air was cool but not cold. The blackness to our left and our right was absolute, giving the illusion of enormous depths, rather than nearby rock cloaked in shadow. This impression was reinforced, I suddenly realized, by the fact that Drum's hoofbeats were not producing any echoes, aftersounds, overtones. 

> The band of stars had narrowed, and it finally vanished above us. We advanced through what seemed a totally black tunnel now, with perhaps the tiniest flickering of light a great distance ahead of us.

> The light had grown large, become a circular opening. It had approached at a rate out of proportion to our advance, as though the tunnel itself were contracting. It seemed to be daylight that was rushing in through what I chose to regard as the cave mouth.

The Void bears similarities to Shadow concepts like "Between" or
"The Outer Darkness", "The Empty Spaces" or "The Deep".  It seems likely that
outer space is a shadow of the Void, which implies a large scale
for the actual Void.

Those who seem to have mastered it:
 + [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict)
 + [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers)
 + [Verra](DemonGoddessVerra)
 + A non-local Princess Chandra, who had lost the Serpent

No player characters are known Void adepts, and as a result this power
is poorly understood by the players.
