## The Wisp

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

Contractor, free-lance, expensive, and designer.  Has the reputation
of making it clean, look accidental, or incidental.  Does not "Send
messages" unless the message is that it is not healthy to get in the
way of whomever might be hiring The Wisp.  No one knows what The Wisp
looks like, and some, who have negotiated for The Wisp's services
might or might not have been talking to a secondary, a plant, or
someone who just had an ear-bud/mic combination on relay.

Price is high, but once agreed, delivery happens.

Does not take jobs with specific time limits.
