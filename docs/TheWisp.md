## The Wisp

Part of the [Inzalo](InzaloShadowEarth) run.

A shrouded figure operating in the world of shadows, tackles unique
and ethically intricate issues beyond the reach of conventional
means. Discreet intelligence gathering, meticulous surveillance, and
the uncanny ability to unearth veiled truths are her weapons of
choice. This shadowy contractor employs advanced technology, a network
of informants, and her own unparalleled resourcefulness to navigate
complex situations with precision. However, the high cost of her
services and the questionable nature of her clientele raise critical
questions about the legality and ethical implications of her
operations. Those seeking The Wisp's assistance encounter layers of
anonymity, unsure if they're communicating directly with the enigmatic
figure or merely a carefully placed intermediary. One thing is
certain: attempting to interfere with The Wisp's business can prove
hazardous to one's health.

Price is high, but once agreed, delivery happens.
