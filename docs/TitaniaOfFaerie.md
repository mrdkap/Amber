>_Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania._

Titania is [Faerie](FaeriePromontory), and Faerie is Titania.

Part of a four-way balance with:
 + [Faythe](FaytheOfCeleste)([Life/Matrix](DarkoverPromontory))
 + [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters)([Undeath](UnDeath))
 + [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel)([Unlife](UnLife))

Queen Titania was [Clarissa's](ClarissaOfDarkover) long-running and mutual nemesis.  Prior to
Unlife and Undeath being acknowledged as minor powers, Life and
Dream considered themselves opposites.

The [Evil alternate version of Benedict](EvilBenedict) rode [Evil Titania](EvilTitania) as a mount.  Our Titania defeated the evil version and kept her defeated form.  At least, we're pretty sure that's who won.
