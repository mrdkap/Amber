For a long time, the campaign's [Big Bad](ToramTheBigBad).  Toram started a revolution in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), involving forbidden [Logrus](TheLogrus) Magic, countless [Logrus](TheLogrus) masters from alternate realities, and other unwholesome allies like [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) and [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover).

Toram has been killed at least four times so far:
 + His body was killed in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), and he was decapitated by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) and his head is a trophy in [Pearl](CorwinPromontory).
 + His soul was 'trapped' in a [Matrix Crystal](LifeMatrix) by [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover), and destroyed by [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) and his magic-eating fish. (Although people only had [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover)'s word for it.)
 + His spirit was poured onto the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern) by a [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) golem created by [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy) and [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy).
 + After it was belatedly discovered that Toram had possessed the [Spiral](TheSpiral) for years, and could influence anyone who walked it, the [Spiral](TheSpiral) was purged by (a sane-ed by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel)) [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber), [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy), and [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy).
