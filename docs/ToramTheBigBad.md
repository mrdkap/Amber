## Things are afoot at the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos)
 + The "AD&D" run from [Cobalt](CobaltPromontory) arrives at the [Abyss](TheAbyss), guided by [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict).
 + [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict) uses [Pattern](PrimalPattern) to bind every [demon](ChaosDemon) within two miles of the [Abyss](TheAbyss) with pattern chains.
 + Stormy rescues [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara), who finds out his cousin [Vlad](HouseCara) is presumed dead (several witnesses) and [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) is now head of [House Cara](HouseCara)
 + [Cathryn](CathrynOfJesby) returns, and fights with a redheaded, Pattern-wielding imposter to [Jesby](ChaosHouses) in the council chamber in [Thelbane](CastleThelbane). [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict) assists the imposter.  A pile of white dust is left behind.
 + [Houses Major and minor Houses](ChaosHouses) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) are attacked.
   + Several House heads are missing.
   + [House Cara](HouseCara) is infested with small black demons that appear from corners and multiply in the presence of the [Logrus](TheLogrus).  [Vlad](HouseCara), the House Second to [REN](House Cara) and titualur house head, is showing up in small pieces pattern-stapled to things around [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) and the [Black Zone](BlackZone).
   + [House Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby) and its ways are "no longer contiguous with the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos)"
   + [House Sawall](HouseSawall) and its holdings are set on fire.
 + [Damia](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana) introduces herself to [Random](RandomOfOberon) as "Paulette", his mother (and technically [Queen in Amber](KingOfAmber)).
 + "rioting" demons begin to appear in the [Courts of Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), followed by a massive invasion of heavily armored blue demons.
 + [Malachai](MalachaiOfCorwin) acts as Regent of [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir), and proposes to Serena.
 + [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian), [Auricle](AuricleOfTir), and [Theraat](TheraatOfVale) loot [Rhiannon](RhiannonOfFiona)'s magical laboratory and home, then travel to [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir).
   + [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) and [Auricle](AuricleOfTir) encounter white dust, and hear of its effects on people, and hear that it is similar to the dust associated with [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin) statues.
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) finds the (real) heads of [House Jesby](ChaosHouses) and [House Cara](HouseCara) in [the Egg-Place](EggPromontory).  (The people who run the house, not just their detached heads.)
 + [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) arrives in [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir) with [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys), to pack up [Brand](BrandOfOberon)'s room.
   + [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) accidentally brings [Ingold](IngoldOfBenedict)'s pattern binding stone, dragging along thousands of demons.  Many melt, others die, none are happy. The "invasion" is repelled.
 + The crew from [Cobalt](CobaltPromontory), along with [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), inflict great umbrage upon the [Shifters Guild](ChaosGuilds#shifters) looking for the missing (abducted?) [Carleton](CobalteanRoyalFamily$carleton).  [Carleton](CobalteanRoyalFamily#carleton) is recovered, and returns to [Cobalt](CobaltPromontory) via a 'mandrake backpack'.
 + Trialla the Shau'um brings [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom), [Jesby](BellahquistOfJesby), and [REN](HouseCara) (who disappears) back to the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos), crossing the Barrier separating [Pearl](CorwinPromontory) from the rest of [Shadow](ShadowPlaces).
 + the undead [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) arrives in [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir), with a shambling guide and the Pig Of Plenty.
 + [Faythe](FaytheOfCeleste), with help from [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys), heals [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) and restores her memories.
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) is given a [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement) by [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber), so that she can contact him.  [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) starts to collect [Vlad](HouseCara) pieces.  [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmmber) gives [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) a pattern-staple remover.
   + [Cathryne](CatherineOfRandom) and [Jesby](BellahquistOfJesby) do some hopping through alternate realities.
 + [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie) tells [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) that refugees from [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos) have been arriving in [Faerie](TitaniaOfFaerie) - as long as they swear fealty to [House Cara](HouseCara), [Faerie](TitaniaOfFaerie) is offering sanctuary.

## Cathryne's Pattern party
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) and [Jesby](BellahquistOfJesby) return to the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).
   + There is a question as to the House-status of [House Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby), because the physical House is missing.  As are the remaining House members.
   + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) reports that, according to a now-unavailable mage, [House Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby) was kicked ahead in time
 + For the first (but not the last) time, [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) uses a barge to cross the new sea of demons pooling in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Snarsht](SnarshtOfBeastmasters), head of the [Beastmasters Guild](BeastmastersGuild), identifies [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) as his "lost apprentice"
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) prepares to walk the [Rebma Pattern](RembaPattern), and [Random](RandomOfOberon) invites "everyone" to her pattern party.
   + With [Queen Moire](MoireOfRebma) of [Rebma](KolvirPromontory#rebma)'s permission, [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) navigates the [Rebma Pattern](RebmaPattern) in four hours and teleports to her pattern party.
 + Lots of people arrive at [Cathryne's](CatheryneOfRandom) pattern party, including apparent duplicates of [Fiona](FionaOfOberon), [Bleys](BleysOfOberon), and [Brand](BrandOfOberon). [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) is there in [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon)'s form, and responding to questions with [Corwin's](CorwinOfOberon) knowledge.  An [Eric](EricOfOberon) is also there.
   + Both [Cassandra](CassandraOfCorwin) and ["Corwin"](NortonOfBeastmasters) have Greyswandir the [Pattern Blade](PatternBlade).
   + [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) imports a serving staff for the party, who are later killed by [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon). (Green cards are very important in [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir), apparently.)
 + [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom) receives many gifts at her party
 + [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) restores the original [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), but later shifts into [Eric](EricOfOberon) with less entertaining results. (<a href="http://www.haven.org/~dskern/www/amber/log970701.txt">log</a>)
 + [Cathryne](CatheryneOfRandom) talks with [Ferethyn](RealmsMageFerethyn) and [Shiryu](RealmsMasterShiryu), who restore (and ward) the physical structure of her house in change for her help with the plague of identical violent demons in the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Snarsht](SnarshtOfBeastmasters), [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara), [Zack](ZachariasOfJulian), and [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) encounter [Gwen](GwenOfDworkin)'s white dust.  They confirm that the dust is conscious, insane (megalomaniacal), and appears when you say [Gwen's](GwenOfDworkin) name.

## Cathryne's Pattern party moves to Chaos
 + [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters), [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara), and [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys) get caught in a Trump trap set by [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).  [Darkstar](DarkStar) is also trapped, and everyone is rescued or escapes.
   + [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) is later threatened by [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) for escaping, and cowers. [Rainbow's](RainbowOfDancers) revenge will be subtle and effective.
 + [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) and [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) are attacked by a major force of [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) in the [Courts](CourtsOfChaos); while fighting them, [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) beastmasters many demons into vampires, Godzillas, Mothras, Snarshts, Triallas, Erics, etc.
   + Many other reinforcements arrive, including [Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom)'s pattern party. [Cathryne](CatheryneOfRandom) returns her [Jewel of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement) to [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber).
   + [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) has carried the new [House Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby) out of chaos and into [Shadow](ShadowPlaces).  [Bella](BellahquistOfJesby), the house head of [Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby), convinces him to bring it back, although the sea of demons has taken up that place so [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) sets it on top of the demons.
 + [Osric](OsricOfChanicut) leaves the [Fringe](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) to look for [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin), and meets [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara).
 + A patternless [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) arrives at [Castle Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber), somewhat confused.  She brings with her [Gerard](GerardOfOberon)'s arm and threats from [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).
   + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), supported by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), declares himself in rebellion against [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).  [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) says that he would consider it a personal slight if any of his relatives failed to support his rebellion. [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) gets widespread, if lukewarm, support.
 + [House Cara](HouseCara) and its allies attack [House Helgram](HouseHelgram), and discover that [Helgram](HouseHelgram) has access to hundreds of thousands of mostly real troops.  [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) starts a mental duel (assisted by [Cassanrda](CassandraOfCorwin)) with one of the minds on the opposing side:  [Toram](ToramOfMages), Guildmaster of the [Mages Guild](ChaosGuilds).  That information is ripped from their heads when [Osric](OsricOfChanicut)'s shields block the mental contact.
 + After passing through a rift in the local Pattern room, [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) encounters [Hillbilly Dworkin](HillbillyDworkin) brooding over the [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) created by that [Suhuy, known as Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy).  [Hillbilly Amber](HillbillyAmber) antics ensue. 
 + [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) draws a pattern over the grave of [Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy), which animates his ectoplasmic ghost.
   + [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin) finds a rift there to the [Evil-Verse](EvilAmber), and frees the [Evil-Verse](EvilAmber) [Eric](EvilEric) and [Flora](EvilFlora) (who aren't particularly evil, it seems) from the prison cell [Oberon](EvilOberon) put them in.  When they reach [Hillbilly Amber](HillbillyAmber), [Eric](EvilEric) burns in the sunlight while [Flora](EvilFlora) cradles the bones of her dead child, [Melvin](EvilMelvin).  [Hillbilly Brand](HillbillyBrand) makes a comment about wind chimes, and gets his head ripped off by [Flora](EvilFlora).
   + [Ferro](FerroOfDworkin), [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy), and [Hillbilly Deirdre](HillbillyDeirdre) travel to local reality.
 + [Caine](CaineOfOberon) is fighting an endless stream of locusts.
 + A [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) walks the [Pattern in Rebma](RebmaPattern), which rips out that which she was (with [Dworkin](DwrokinOfAmber)'s help) and makes her more [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon). [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) suspects this [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) is really [Dara](DaraOfOfOfBenedict).
 + [Bellaquist](BellahquistOfJesby) ([Cathryne](CathryneOfRandom)'s mother, and the house head of [House Jesby](ChaosHouses#jesby)) requests extreme sanctuary from [House Cara](HouseCara), after being threatened by the enemy and presented with Mandor's arm ([House Sawall](HouseSawall) ring attached).
   + The enemy houses are:  [Swayvill](HouseSwayvill), [Chanicut](HouseChanicut), [Ganda](HouseGanda), [Darbin](HouseDarbin), [Yigrin](HouseYigrin), [Helgram](HouseHelgram), [Arantantic](HouseArantantic).

## [Jenoir's](JenoirOfMages) Elevation (vs Toram)
 + [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy) is discovered to be missing
 + [Jenoir](JenoirOfMages) is elevated to Guildmaster of the [Mages Guild](ChaosGuilds), after being rescued.
 + [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) is rescued from [Rebma](KolvirPromontory#rebma), where she is trapped in a table made of solid blue 'stuff' inert to pretty much every power and the density and coloration of [Rebman](KolvirPromontory#rebma) water.  Much later, it will be nicknamed ['Blucite'](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).
   + [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) is freed by [Osric](OsiricOfChanicut), because in some way [Fringe](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) Power is the opposite of [Blucite](PowersBalancesAndOpposites).
 + [Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber) is attacked by strange blue watery things, which eat many rangers.
 + [Toram](ToramOfMages) is defeated multiple times, although the PCs must revive [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) from a dessicated form apparently caused by [Toram](ToramOfMages).
   + Blackwand, the [Morgani Weapon](MorgantiWeapon) that [Toram's](ToramOfMages) soul is fed to, has kittens.  Deryhse is also implicated in the parentage.  These weapons are small Morganti daggers, so black they're pink, and somehow cattish.
 + [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) walks the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern) at age five, thanks to a secret passage into [Primal Kolvir](KolvirPromontory#primalkolvir) and [Brand](BrandOfOberon)'s garden of leprous frogs.
   + [Ilk](IlkandacianOfCara) talks a dreaming [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) into dreaming of [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy), and [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) travels to [Suhuy's](LogrusMasterSuhuy) location - embedded in a [Jewel Of Judgement](JewelOfJudgement) in an alternate reality.  [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy) is rescued, just before he comes to an "accomodation" with the Jewel.
 + [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir) is invaded, again.  This time, the invasion force is the "People Of Jade", not-so-smart folk who can swim through rock and are swarming out of Garnath.  The people are backed up by the occasional giant.  [Amber](KolvirPromontory#shadowkolvir) is defended by Chaosians (and [Malachi](MalachiOfCorwin)) for a while, then [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) gets bored and changes Garnath into Spam.  This blocks the invasion force, but creates a vast amount of spam.
 + [Cassanrda](CassandraOfCorwin) becomes the apprentice of [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins), after discovering that the Sith are a cadet (fringe?) branch of the [Assassins Guild](AssassinsGuild).

## Party and Amber Formal Court
 + Formal Court is held in Amber by its two surviving queens:  [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) and [Damia](CobalteanRoyalFamily#damiana) (a.k.a. "Paulette").
   + [Neville](NevilleOfEric) (later revealed as ["Eric Junior"](NevilleOfEric)) arrives at the court somewhat by accident, on a tracking mission.  He survives the encounter because no one wants to upset [Flora](FlorimelOfOberon) by killing a guest at her function.
   + A shapeshifter from [House Helgram](HouseHelgram) is [pink morganti'd](MorgantiWeapon) and budded into by [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel), setting the stage for Jean's later consumption and assumption of the demon horde in [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Suhuy](LogrusMasterSuhuy) and [Gentleman Suhuy](GentlemanSuhuy) create a [Variable Pattern](VariablePattern) golem and pour [Toram](ToramOfMages)'s essence onto the [Primal Pattern](PrimalPattern), destroying it.  [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) is pissy, but distractable.
 + [Malachi](MalachiOfCorwin) is acknowledged by the Queens as Regent for [Amber's King](KingOfAmber).
 + [Celeste](CelesteOfBleys) trumps [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian), who is in [Rebma](KolvirPromontory#rebma) confronting [Evil Benedict](EvilBenedict).  [Zach](ZachariasOfJulian) is distracted and killed.
   + [Zach's](ZachariasOfJulian) body and soul are retrieved, and [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) later re-integrates them.  [Zach](ZacharaiasOfJulian) has no memory of his death, and events are engineered to keep him from realizing it. <a href="http://www2.primushost.com/~dskern/amber/log980825.html">(log)</a>
 + [Evil Benedict](EvilBenedict) moves toward [Castle Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber), [Clarissa](ClarissaOfDarkover) dismisses formal court and the attendees leave hastily.  [Evil Benedict](EvilBenedict) takes control of [Castle Amber](KolvirPromontory#castleamber), killing everything down to microscopic life.
