Early in Amber's history, [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) children [Osric](OsricOfOberon) and [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon) died "For the Good of Amber" after Oberon dissolved his marriage with their mother, [Cymnea](CymneaOfBarimen).

The most popular story of their demise is this:  [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) children were fond of traying down the mountain stairway on [Kolvir](KolvirPromontory) (sitting on a tray and sledding down the stairs).  The bumping down the stairs kept waking [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) up from his late-night celebrations with his new wife [Faiella](FaiellaPrincessOfBegma), so one night [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) took extreme steps.

The next morning, before dawn, [Oberon's](OberonOfDworkin) three sons started traying down the stairs as usual.  However, [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) had changed Amber such that the Great Stairway now had turns instead of being straight the whole way down - and [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon) and [Osric](OsricOfOberon) sailed over the edge, followed by [Benedict's](BenedictOfOberon) tray as the youngest brother held onto the stairway by the tips of his fingers.

So that's how [Finndo](FinndoOfOberon) and [Osric](OsricOfOberon) died - for the good of Amber.

(This story is probably a complete fabrication, and was spread by [Bridget/Rivka](RivkaOfBenedict), but is still the most popular story.)
