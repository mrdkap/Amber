A competent (mostly) version of [Merlin](MerlinOfCorwin) from the [Uber-Verse](UberVerse) which is a more powerful alternate Amber chord.

Merlin sat on the throne of that [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos), with an ultra-powerful artifact at his disposal: a staff that possessed an entire [Logrus](TheLogrus), [Pattern](PrimalPattern), and major aspects of [Trump](TrumpDeck) within it.

He also had a pattern-based hammer that, somehow was also sharp, called [Mjolnir](PatternBlade).  It was later appropriated by [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin).

Upon request from [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers), Merlin came over to [Amber Local](KolvirPromontory) in order to help [Rainbow](RainbowOfDancers) deal with [Toram](ToramOfMages), who at this point was a slow-moving [shadow](ShadowPlaces).
