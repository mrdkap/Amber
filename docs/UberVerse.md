The Uber-Verse is a chord of the Local Amberverse, with a much higher power level across all it's inhabitants.

The only known survivor of Amber/Chaos conflicts in the UberVerse was [Uber Merlin](UberMerlin), who arrived in our reality with all of the notable artifacts of his reality stored inside his body, along with an ridiculously powerful staff.  UberMerlin has not been seen in some time and the local [Oberon](OberonOfDworkin) was using his stuff, so that Merlin is presumed deceased.

[UberMjolnir](PatternBlade) is part of the [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel) collective but most other Uber artifacts are not accounted for and were last known to be looted from Oberon by [Neville](NevilleOfEric).
