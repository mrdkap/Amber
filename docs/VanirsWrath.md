This is a promontory with a strange history.  It is where Vanir [Tate](LaetatioOfRandom)'s non-amberite Father) originated from, the source of [Bibliomancy](PowersBalancesAndOpposites) and where the [Archivist](CaelinOfLaetatio) - apparently an alternate [Caelin](CaelinOfLaetatio) - originates from.  As a single promontory, it was shattered into pieces (when it earned it's name) and also was a target of a mind-wipe by Jean.  It is halfway between Shadow known to the players and the [Hamsterverse](HamsterVerse).
