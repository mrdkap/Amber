The [Chaosian](CourtsOfChaos) guild of combat, martial arts, and the like. Guild promotion is done by single combat. The token of the guild master is the stone sword, a primal weapon thought by some to be the first weapon.  The token of the guild second is the stone dagger, a slightly less primal weapon perhaps created after the wielder of the stone sword got tired of lugging it around.

The Warrior's Guild fought against [Amber](ShadowKolvir) as part of [King](KingOfChaos) [Borel's](BorelOfHendrake) coalition in the [Pattern Fall](PatternFall) war.

The known Warrior's Guild guild heads are:
 + [Marial](RealmsLords), now the Warlord
 + Someone, killed by [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon) during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall)
 + [Benedict](BenedictOfOberon), who eventually found out that he was the head of the guild. Mostly by guild members trying to win the position randomly challenging him and attacking him with witnessess.
 + [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) was automatically promoted (from Guild Second) after [Benedict](BenedictOfAmber) was trapped in another reality.
 + [Cyndia](CyndiaOfBenedict), after [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) and [Caine](CaineOfOberon) disappeared and were thought killed.  It is still unclear to most folks how [Cyndia](CyndiaOfBenedict) was picked, although she has since proven her mettle to many of the guild members.  It was by inehritence, and testing of those who were known to be of [Benedict's](BenedictOfAmber) line.

Warrior's Guild seconds have included:
 + Duke [Borel](BorelOfHendrake), killed by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) during [Pattern Fall](PatternFall)
 + [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon), who eventually found out that he was the guild second and therefore moved to [Chaos](CourtsOfChaos).
 + [Caine](CaineOfOberon), appointed by [Corwin](CorwinOfOberon) as guild second after [Benedict's](BenedictOfOberon) disappearance.
 + [Raven](RavenOfCaine) being of the line of [Caine](CaineOfOberon) after [Caine's](CaineOfOberon) death.
