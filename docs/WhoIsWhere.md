## Cobalteans

Look at the [Cobaltean Royal Family](CobalteanRoyalFamily) page for more detail.

Most of the Cobaltians were in the same place - which was not Cobalt.  It was the [Egg Place](EggPromontory), but then they moved back to their promontory, when [Erica](CobalteanRoyalFamily#erica) trumped them that all is stable, and they have begun to rebiuld.
