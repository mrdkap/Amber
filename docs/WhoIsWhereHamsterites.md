## Hamsterites

The Hamsters of which all other hamsters are merely shadows.  Or some junk.

Created originally in a locked room, to be simply a visual aid, to explain the, at the time, current [Family Amber](WhoIsWhereAmberites) difficulties, the way they were created somehow enabled them to be quite real, and of the bloodlines, and with the characteristics of the [Amberites](WhoIsWhereAmberites).  All of them have walked at least their [Pattern](PrimalPattern), situated in the [[HamsterVerse]] and some have even more impressinve credentials to their credit.  Yes, they are actually hamsters, not hamster sized people.  Fur and all.

The [[HamsterVerse]] is their new home. An invite there is a signal honor, or a statement that you need to spend some time studying Dworkinetics.  Sometimes both.

Dworkinetics is a whole new way of looking at an individuals place in the universe.  It seems to be mostly successful in those that are taught this way, to get along better with, in comparison to trying to oppose the entire universal order, and change it to their image.

All of the Hamsterites rank as Child Of [Dworkin](DworkinOfAmber) level ([Oberon](OberonOfDworkin), basically) in general stats, with individuated talents as per the moulding and storytelling of [Jean](JeanOfFlorimel).  And yet, the Hamsterites are quite compassionate, and are often willing to help those who have befrended them.
