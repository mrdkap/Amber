Picture a grand, open field, with a large ash tree in the distance, its branches overhead, bravely spread, it's proud thick trunk, and it's roots, digging deep into the soil. You might see little black dots floating about in it's upper branches, or maybe the flick of what looks like a tiny squirrel passing upward or downward.

Then you realize that the dots are giant corvids, thrusting Yggdrasil deep into the distance, and realizing the gentle rolling land is actually mountanous foothills.  And that's one dragon-sized squirrel.  And Yggdrasil seems to have put all of it's branches out of casual reach.

In the foreground there is a large pavillion, with the smell of good food, and occasionally the sound of music emerging from it, when the [Clown Prince](CorwinOfOberon) can be moved to perform.

Inside the pavilion there is a central section with a grand feast (that never seems to wilt, rot, or putrify) layed out and pleanty of tables and benches, for a number of differntly-heighted individuals.  There is also some sleeping partitions off to either side.

The pavillion is still flying the flag of the unicorn, although the permeation of pattern is no logner felt (for those who have visitied before).

If you do take a walk over to the base of Ygg, you will realize how giant the tree really is.  And you might, if you time it right, find a chess-board tucked in one of the folds of the roots, with the phrase "In honor of the Argo" carved into it's base.
