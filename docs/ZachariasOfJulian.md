Zack or Zach, child of [Julian](JulianOfOberon) and an unknown mother (although the speculation is that [Titania](TitaniaOfFaerie), or one of hers was his mother, or one of the wood nymphs of the [Forest of Arden](ForestOfArden) which might amount to the same thing).  Is a Prince in [Faerie](TitaniaOfFaerie), with Sidhe Warriors at his command.  Has somehow ended up as vice in charge of all of the armed forces in [Amber](KolvirPromontory) having been asked by, and accepted said role by all the actual commanders.  Since [Auricle](AuricleOfTir) considers him a very trustworthy partner, there hasn't been a shift of that, even after the Pattern Redraw.

He has a strong sense of duty, a good sense of humor, and a sense of obligation to his [father](JulianOfOberon).  He still is in mourning over his death.

Zach has never died.  Just ask [Norton](NortonOfBeastmasters) and see also this [log](http://web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/log980825.html).
