Zorro is a member of the [Assassin's Guild](ChaosGuilds) and a former apprentice of [Princess Chandra](PrincessChandraOfAssassins).

To the best of popular knowledge, Zorro went insane and started believing in truth, justice, charity, fairness and that sort of thing.  He remains one of the most dangerous individuals in the multiverse, and those who know him try to stay on his good side.
