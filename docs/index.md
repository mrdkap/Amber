Welcome to the Amber wiki!

Probably the best place to start is the [Who is Where](WhoIsWhere), the [Powers, Balances, and Opposites](PowersBalancesAndOpposites), or the [Places to Go](PlacesToGo) pages.  Or use the "Search" with &amp;type=Wikis above or the "Find a Page ..." to the right.

More historically minded folks might want to start with the [Before Times](BeforeTime), [overview timeline](Timeline) or the logs/journals from Malachai's Journals [1](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_1.txt) [2a](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_2a.txt) [2](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_2.txt) [3](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_3.txt) [4](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs/malachai_journal_4.txt), the most impressive [run log archive](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/), or the later [run logs](//plan-b.org/~dkap/Amber/logs).

More hysterically minded folks might want to start with the [game quotes](//web.mit.edu/~dskern/www/amber/quotes.html)
