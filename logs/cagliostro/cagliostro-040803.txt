in the fractal realm - Hubert rides up before we get to Erica.  Hubert
says that some prisoners escaped because Cagliostro's refugees were
set to guard them.

There is some discussion of the wisdom of including them in the
assault on Erica - Hubert goes off to track down the prisoners.

Party progresses forward; reaches the battle site.  Cagliostro finds
something to hide behind, and checks - no serious injuries on our
side. The ninja goes off to scout.

Gil comes over to the group, briefs them - castle with an impenetrable
magical shield over it.  Darn good troops, led by an excellent general
- trying to lose anyone. 

The shield does seem to be impenetrable - can't see through it.
Magic-eating crystals stay in air, don't gain or lose power.  Can't
conjure things in touch with the screen or inside it.

"I can't stay here - the former head of the mage's guild is here" Some
discussion, without fleeing - Caelin is very concerned, but says his
magic level is very expended. Caelin is a 2 on the magic scale
(Cagliostro is usually about an 11).

Natasha exudes blind spot and hero worship for Benedict.

Natasha briefs Cagliostro - "All that remains of the greatest mage -
that scares my husband silly - may be concentrated here." 

A foo fighter comes over and explains that Erica is contaminated by
this individual and was resistant to cleanup.  Some discussion happens
between the fighter and Janus; Janus catapults over the castle.  At
apogee, an eight hundred foot stone golem appears and drops onto the
castle.  The shield drops (crushing cities), but is not broken.
