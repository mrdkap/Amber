Cagliostro follows Natasha for a while through changing landscape,
then they arrive at the broken shell and destroyed city. 

There is a conversation with the invisible presence, who pulls them
through on a chunk of stone with chairs and seatbelts.

Cagliostro starts fixing Janus (silver burned and chelated) and
Amaranth.
