Cagliostro finds that Cemen is near the Sea of Thought at the base of
the ramp.

Cemen is sitting at the edge of the Sea, slumped over.  He does not
respond to being greeted, but the Sea does.  ("Is he all right?  He
just slumped over.") Cagliostro checks his life energy is low, his
fluid content is lower.

Cagliostro fixes Cemen, fluids and nutritions.

"Did I pass?"  Cemen points at the suns.  "They're still there!"
Cagliostro says "I believe so." 

Cagliostro explains the City of Crows plan, and Cemen is agreeable to
a field trip.  He asks where the city is - Cagliostro realizes he
doesn't know.

Cagliostro gives Cemen a Trump of himself, and explains its use.
Cemen admits that concentration is how he unmakes things - Cagliostro
pales and considers the situation.

Cagliostro conjures a paper wrapping for the Trump and suggests
passing it on to someone else should Cemen be in need of assistance.

Cagliostro, Mistress Janice, Gil, the sword-sisters, Colin, and
Kintani assemble to find the City of Crows. After a bit, Kintani begs
off to help Ilkandacian find "Titania's missing mind".
