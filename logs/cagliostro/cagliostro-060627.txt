Skeptical of Roland, Malcom looks for signs of civilizations and
tracks radio signals to a planet.  The level of the technology on the
planet is pre-spaceflight

The areas of interest are not stable enough to land the ship, so
Kaylee (with Cagliostro's help) builds a shuttlecraft out of things
that were on the ship or that Cagliostro found.  Malcolm and Kaylee
takes the ship down to the surface to scout, and returns several hours
later looking stunned.  Malcolm wanders off looking stunned, and
Kaylee works on improving flaws that she found in the shuttle.
(Kaylee now implicitly believes Roland - the laws of physics have
changed.)
