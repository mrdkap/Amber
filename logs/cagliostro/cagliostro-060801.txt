Malcolm runs around and tries to re-establish his feeling of being an
alpha male.  Malcolm discusses opening up trade routes, but needs to
find out what a 'shadow path' is.  

River gets off the ship surreptiously (probably via
shadow-walking). Her brother can't find her.  Hamster Brand declines
to comment, and Cagliostro realizes that she may have shifted into
vacuum.  Cagliostro tries to scry her, and fails.  Cagliostro talks to
Mistress Janice, who is not so good with the scrying.

Brand says that he can probably find her, but is unsure of her state
or whether he can affect it.  He suggests that Cagliostro use the
cards to contact him shortly after they left.  Brand turns the
piloting over to Malcolm, and goes for a walk.

Cagliostro realizes they should have tested the cards, and uses them
to contact Brand.  Brand replies with pain and a desire to return.
Brand returns with her head and a bit of spinal column.  "That's bad!"

Cagliostro breathes on her spark of life, records her memories (brain
is still mostly working), and starts working on her.  Brand goes off
to clean up, and the doctor starts to run down.  Cagliostro ensures
that he becomes groggy and knocks himself out.

Cagliostro creates a jar with regenerative fluid and works on River.
Kaylee comes down and offers her help, Cagliostro suggests
technobabble flesh regeneration and she (tearfully) continues.
