Malcolm has become bored and curious about the King and wants to
either go out and explore or bring in people to question.  Cagliostro
does not approve of this plan, given history.  Malcolm asks Cagliostro
how he would find out more about the King - Cagliostro says first by
learning about those people that the King surrounds himself with.
Malcolm decides that Cagliostro is one of those people (despite
Cagliostro's demurrals) and decides to learn more about Cagliostro.

Cagliostro talks to Malcolm about information, societies and freedom
of choice - including the freedom to ignore choices. 

Malcolm says if they could leave, then "Serenity Valley" wouldn't have
happened.  Cagliostro inquires. Simon provides his computerized
encylopedia and Zoe provides color commentary.  Cagliostro learns
about the Firefly 'Verse.

Cagliostro attempts to explain to Malcolm the mindset of those who
view power as an end and not as a means.  Malcolm doesn't get it.
Mistress Janice provides hot chocolate.
