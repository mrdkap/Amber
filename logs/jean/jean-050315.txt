Ilk: Sound the alert - the black council is attacking Chaos, attacking
the serpent in the sea.

Jean: tells Max, whalespeaks Kintani, runs to Princess Chandra at the
edge of the Philosopher's Sea.

Mandor, when told, evacuates Mandorways from Chaos.

Ilk asks to borrow the pattern Mjolnir, Jean agrees - they arrive at
the battle in the sea of chance under Chaos.  It sounds like a good
idea to the hammer, who charges in to help Princess Chandra.

The wyrm attacks the serpent on a bald spot - the hammer interposes
(or is interposed) and blocks most of the blow.  The Serpent is
scored, and moves in pain.

Kintani and Pharaban dive into the dragon, and the dragon redoubles
its attacks.  

Max starts 'wielding' Jean, and massively upgrades his warfare.
(Somewhere in the back of Jean's head, lots of warfare is starting to
make sense.)

There is a transition, and the hammer is very uncomfortable and loses
access to its stat increase.  The hammer plays dead to try to keep a
low profile.

House Swayville is experiencing difficulties - some reachable pieces
are unreachable, some ways are broken.  

Max grabs Jean and carries him physically into battle, smacking two of
the black council that are attacking the serpent from 'behind'.  On
one of the smacks, the council member disappears.
