Ilk asks Jean to watch an icecube shipped to Amber out of the Sea.
(Put in a reminder in the Dancer's Guild in case of unexplained boom.)

Ilk says that Dalktontyr has been found - talks to Jean in Chaos, to
determine whose ship it is.  The surviving redheads inherit from
Clarissa and Gwen.

Brendhyn is missing
Brandt is sitting outside the room that used to be Llewella's
Felice is recovering from overindulging in empathic healing
Faythe is also there

Faythe leaves the matter in Ilk's hands, asking him to put it
someplace out of the way.  

Ilk asks about a fringe gate in the egg place - it may still be there,
Jean can't tell.

Ilk puts up a viewscreen of the bald spot in Chaos, and talks about
how some people are looking to induce the Savior of Chaos to help in
their business proposition.  Jean makes popcorn and watches the
viewscreen with REN.
