At Max's, Kintani brought out a tank and a fringe car with Johnny.  Kintani
asked Jean if the tank was his; it isn't, because it's actually alive.

Jean discussed getting more Jeans from the sea in the hamsterverse and
using them to keep an eye on the realities inside his handprints.

Jean was removed from Kintani's handprints so that Kintani et al could travel through Jean.

Kintani, another dragon, and Johnny are in the lab in Gwen's shadow.
Jean is still running what's left of Julian's armies and has the clone
generators on standby, and is trying to keep an eye on the wall paintings
to see if they're in use.  Things are quiet.
