Jean tips Silver Lyra off that Osric is returning to Chaos, and she
greets him on his return to talk to him about a matter of state.

Jean and Ilk wake up Shiryu and let him know that Shadow is reforming
and about to hit Chaos.  Jean lets REN know, and REN asks to be
evacuated to a point of Jean's off-site backups.  Jean fishes REN
someplace random and far away (badgerverse?).

Jean lets the Hamsterites know about what is going on.

Auricle wants to go to Amber - specified as the Pattern - to find out
what went wrong.  Jean decides to talk to Dworkin, then decides to
bring Auricle to talk to Dworkin.  Since Auricle's Gargoyle box
doesn't fit in a fish, and Auricle doesn't go anywhere without
Gargoyle, Jean brings in Celia to transport Auricle to Dworkin.

Auricle talks to Dworkin for a while, then Jean transports her to
Amber.  She is surprised that Amber is there, and speculates that
Amber pushed the new Pattern away, "if such a thing is possible".
