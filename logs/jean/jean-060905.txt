In the Assassin's Guild, the group finds a parasite in Kaylee that
they are unfamiliar with, but seems like the sort of thing Jean has
done before.

Jean passes a message from Ilk to Titania that after Shadow's
reformation he has seen signs of Max's daughter, but thinks she's
avoiding his tendrils.  Jean asks if it's like when Erika was
possessed by Gwen, but Ilk says no - his tendrils are missing her, not
dying.  Titania asks Jean to tell Ilk to keep up the good work.

Kintani asks Jean to tell Cagliostro that Malcolm is in a specific
abandoned building - Jean checks the building, and determines that it
is the old Poisoner's guild.  This is considered quite bad.

Jean talks to his assassins about the Poisoner's guild, and they
decline to get involved - an army would require the King's sanction,
and since Princess Chandra will likely show up when she finds out
about it they don't want to be involved.  They suggest telling the
King, which Jean does.  The King passes the buck over to Ilk.

Jean offers MechaJean.  Ilk lets him know that Marial has declined it,
and that she's taking over since Princess Chandra is busy.  He offers
her an army of assassins, and she declines that as well.

Norton shows up to help Cagliostro with the poison. Big stomping
happens at the poisoner's guild.  Malcolm is rescued by Marial and Zoe
and dragons (and two warriors, one of whom survives) and comes out not
looking well.  At Kintani's request, Jean uses a barcalounger to
transfer Malcolm to outside the Assassin's Guild.  Norton starts to
work on Malcolm, but says it would be easier to start over.
