Kintani, Caelin, Natasha, River, and the Phoenix guy arrive in the
Assassin's Guild.  Caelin and Natasha vanish, replaced by Simon.

Kintani says that Cagliostro is trying to heal River by balancing her
elements, but she doesn't have any Jean - or Ilk.  Jean agrees to help
with that, and asks Kintani to pull in a Jean.  Kintani steps out,
snags a saucer, and in a house.

Jean says hello to River, who collapses when she tries to touch Jean.
Jean says "Hm, too much Jean."  Simon gets pissy at the Phoenix Heir.

Kintani says she's an uncontrolled telepath - so Jean whales in some
of Corwin's hangover cure.  Cagliostro comes over to fix River, and
collapses back in the chair.

River recovers, drinks the cure, and feels better.  Kaerlin the
Phoenix heir drinks the hangover cure, and it fails to help him.
Notes happen in the Dancer's Guild.

Cagliostro awakens briefly, drinks Corwin's hangover cure, and it
seems to help.  He brings Kaerlin into a trump connection, and Kaerlin
vanishes.

Kintani excuses himself eventually, but everyone else hangs around.
