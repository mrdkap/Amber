Someone in the Dancer's Guild comes to Ilk and reports that we are
lost. "Lost in the sense of 'oh god it's over' or 'we don't know where
we are?'". Lost in the sense of where are we.

Jean makes sure that REN and Silver Lyra know that the guild is
missing. Jean goes outside, and forgets what he was doing. Jean
compares the situation to Pride's Folly, and Silver Lyra looks
thoughtful, melts out and returns.  She says not to tell anyone else
about it, it's Dancer's Guild business.

Jean starts collecting ghosts.

For some areas, things get very interesting.  Jean pays attention.

Jean in Amber has a bit of a head cold - and then suddenly everything
becomes much more interesting with a lot of different textures.
