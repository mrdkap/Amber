Ilk passes a note to Jean for Princess Chandra - placed in a special
spot.  He is about to do something stupid - always good to leave a
note first.  Returns quickly, gives a second note to Jean with
"relevance, import, and urgency" - but the assassin's can't get to the
meeting.

Serpent's Antechamber is the place of the meeting.  Give both notes to
the plant - explain the situation to the plant.  The plant takes the
notes, and they vanish.  A response is passed back, and delivered to
Ilk in the other universe.

Ilk arrives in Shiryu's antechamber - Shiryu appears - answering
machine apparition appears.

Jean reports into Neville about what happened to the attack Neville
questions him about the status of things.  (10 minutes elapsed time)

-------------------

Caelin is trying to help dragon eggs hatch, and starts to break one of
the eggs out.  The dragon hatchling apparently starts dying, and
Caelin tries to stop it.  Caelin talks to the dragon, and asks Jean to
talk to about the Serpent's Apprentice.

Melk's signature is on the eggs - they're still stasised from the poisoning.

Jean distracts Norton and brings in Jeremiah to fix the egg.

Strange chick collapses out of a waveform, surprised Caelin remembers her.

The chick touches Jeremiah and the dragon, and the dragon starts to
move and hatch.  The dragon is upset at Caelin still being poisoned,
and takes a de-poisoned Caelin out of the egg place.

Coral destasises an egg, and the dragons ask it to hatch.  Eight more
eggs, then kind of collapses.  She eats food that Ilk brings in.

Stands up, does some more eggs, takes breaks for food, drink, sleep.
